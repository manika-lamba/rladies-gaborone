### Inspiration:
This is a nice, clean set of texts perfect for exploring Natural Language Processing techniques

1. Topic modelling: Which topics have become more popular over time? Which have become less popular?
2. Sentiment analysis: Are there differences in tone between different Presidents? Presidents from different parties?
3. Parsing: Can you train implement a parser to automatically extract the syntactic relationships between words?
4. Authorship identification: Can you correctly identify the author of a previously unseen address?
