"1",1.4,"Good. It IS a page turner. You can read this book in one day, two at the most, and the plot drives the whole book. The unreliable narrators (there are two besides the main character) are as unlikable as they are unreliable, and there isn't a nice male in the book. Entirely plot driven; the characters are paper thin. You can figure out who-dunnit by the middle of the book. The ending is weak. I can't imagine what all the fuss is about, except that it is quick and there are lots of twists and turns, and you can't trust anyone to tell the truth.",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,4,2,3
"3",7.75,"I think I would ordinarily cut this book more of a break because it is fast-paced - Hawkins wastes zero time describing anything that doesn't have to do with exactly what is going on in the moment - and while that doesn't make her a great writer, there is absolutely nothing here that will transcend, or reverberate within you long after you've finished reading - it at least doesn't bog you down with preciousness. But because the book has received so many rave reviews - I have to judge it more harshly because it just isn't deserved. This is serviceable writing at best - about the level you'd read on Fiction Press - about the level you would get from a first year MFA student. If someone is digging around in something, they are 'scrabbling' (over and over). The lead character's blackouts are along the lines of: ""I couldn't remember. It was all dark. All black. All cloudy. Couldn't remember."" I'm making that up, but it's not significantly different. So, that's the writing, let's get to the plot.The book is told from the POV of three different female characters, none of them compelling in the slightest. We're supposed to care deeply that a woman who chronically cheats on her husband disappears. I really didn't care that she did, frankly. Then we're supposed to care that Rachel, who drinks too much on the train while she pretends to commute to a job she doesn't have and obsesses about her ex-husband and her 'barren womb', may or may not have witnessed a crime. I didn't care about Rachel, didn't care about the woman who'd gone MIA. Now let's get to the third character you can't care about - Anna. I don't even remember her place in the story I cared about her so little. Oh, right, she's the woman who is responsible for the breakdown of Rachel's marriage and is now married to Rachel's ex, Tom.As others have noted, the three female characters have little to discern them from each other, and speak in a nearly identical voice - except one of them drinks. All three lament about men - constantly. They seem to have no other life interests - not one has a hobby, a job, or anything compelling her forward from day to day that doesn't have to do with a guy. (The guys all turn out to be jerks.)I suppose people like this do exist, I'm just not sure why I'm supposed to care about them - or why anyone else did, or how this book got to be so popular. I've heard it was compared to Gone Girl but other than both having a missing woman at the core, and 'Girl' in the title, there seems to be no comparison whatsoever.The 'twist' isn't a twist in the slightest, just the reveal of the missing woman's murderer, and it's exactly who, about three-fourths of the way through (and I'm not good at guessing twists), you suspect it is.  Then the 'reveal' is the guy confessing he did it in a speech you'd hear some cartoonish villain give in a super hero movie or soap opera. That kind of 'Bwahahaha I did it!' thing. Very convenient.But I guess the biggest thing that bothered me was that the entire crux of the story is based on the idea that Rachel has an alcoholic blackout - and the author explains (twice) that when you are having an alcoholic blackout, your brain does not create memories - so there is nothing to 'remember'- but then lo and behold she suddenly has a memory breakthrough, and solves the crime. I thought she wouldn't have been creating memories? It's as if the author wrote half her book, then decided to do some research (googling) and when she found research that blatantly contradicted the plot point her book hinges on, decided ""Oh, what the heck, I'll keep writing"" and then decided to INCLUDE her research. And her editor didn't notice or (more likely) didn't care.A couple of other things an editor (if this book had one) should have picked up on: Much is made of a pile of clothes by the train tracks - so much so that the book opens with a description of them - the importance of the clothes? None. Zip. Zero. And there's a red haired man who keeps popping up - muttering esoteric things - we assume he will be integral to the mystery. Nope, he just disappears.Other stuff I could complain about but it would be spoilery. It seems if books are bought by book clubs, they become huge sellers, no matter how evisceratingly terrible (witness 50 Shades of Grey).Here's one thing I admire the author for: She wrote this book in four months (it shows) and it became a HUGE bestseller. Awesome for her. So few authors ever make it to that level - even with stunningly well-written books - so kudos to her for whatever alchemy happened to guarantee she's got some money to retire on.",7,10,4,8,11,9,9,16,13,33

The story was not that compelling. The characters were whiny or self-serving. The pacing was glacial.I would never have picked up this book on my own after my experience of reading Gone Girl except it was a selection of my book club. Any book that is compared to Gone Girl will be a book that I will strike from my list of possible reads. Girl on a Train also has one of the worst covers that I have ever seen. The lettering on the cover is probably very effective in trying to give a feeling of motion because it gives me motion sickness every time I look at it.This book was not an enjoyable read for me.

We all seem to enjoy looking into other people’s lives and catching a glimpse of what a stranger’s private life might be like.This book kept me guessing until the last minute. Because the author narrated different chapters in the first person by three alternating characters, we are able to get to know them from the inside out, understand how their minds work, and see how they evolve as the tension of the murder mystery builds. This is a very clever way to both allow the reader to relate to the characters and their feelings, as well as to tell a story from varying viewpoints. I bet you can’t put this one down!

I can understand the comparison to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which I loved, in that the characters aren't the least bit likable or the kind of people anyone would want to be friends with. Rachel is weak and whiny, Anna is self-absorbed and stupid, and Megan is self-indulgent and reckless. All three are ridiculously juvenile. There's very little dialogue, a huge part of the narrative is backstory, and one of the characters is constantly blacking out and remembers nothing, which I found not all that believable.

Typically I read historical fiction and contemporary romance so this book isn't usually what I would buy but I had heard it was impossible to put down. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the novel even though it was creepy and I felt that nothing quite added up. Something always felt a bit off. The novel had me at the edge of my seat and I finished the second half of the book in one day. I really had a hard time putting it down because the author has a way with storytelling where she ends the chapter with a cliffhanger and I just had to know what happened next. The book switches back and forth between the female narrators and the dates when certain events took place so it was sometimes a bit difficult to follow in the beginning and keep track of where everyone was on the same date but after awhile the dates got closer together and everything came together. The ending was a big surprise to me and I never would've guessed it. Like I said, I don't typically read psychological thrillers but I am glad I took a chance on this one.

For whatever reason, I had a hard time connecting with the book in the beginning, but kept at it at the insistence of so many friends. I am so glad I did. It was slow at the beginning, but it paid off in the end. The book is told from the point of view of three different women. The unreliable narrator tactic worked well with the way the author told the story from different dates. If you liked Gone Girl you will like this book. I don't see how my review is even necessary or helpful considering how many reviews this amazing book and author already have, but I wanted to share anyway. Once I got into the book, I could not put it down and had to know what would happen next. I guessed who the killer was, but I don't think that means anything. The book is a psychological thriller not a mystery so the suspense comes from wondering if our MC will escape the dangers posed by the villain and not from solving the mystery of who dun it. It was a nail biting experience at the end as I worried for two of the main characters and wondered what would happen. I can't say more without giving it away.If you are one of the few who has not read this book, you simply must read it. Please don't let the slow start put you off. You will see, soon enough that it was worth the wait. This novel is unique and not like any other book out there. It shares many of the same plot techniques and narrative as Gone Girl, but the story is completely different from Gone Girl and from any other book. That's what makes the book such a hit.If you have read this book and loved it like I did, I highly recommend that you read, Peter Swanson's The Kind Worth Killing. It hooks you much quicker and it is every bit as good as The Girl on the Train. Both are at the top of my all time favorite books.

Not fast, but compelling.  The characters are not chock-full of surprises until the very end of the novel, but they are moved along well enough by author Paula Hawkins.

Is it weird of me to say that it was almost a relief to not feel like I had to root for anyone? The women all become more sympathetic by the end of the story, but overall it was fun to read a book that I didn’t want to put down without having any emotional ties to any one character.I found this book to be fairly fast-paced and without much extraneous plot that wasn’t related to the mystery. I couldn’t put it down because I just had to know how it ended. Whereas I found myself baffled by the lack of a decisive ending in Gone Girl, this was not the case in The Girl on the Train and I appreciated that a full story was told from start to finish, with no open questions remaining.It’s an intriguing mystery that will be just as good as you pass the time on a cold winter’s night as it will be this summer on the beach.",0,5,1,2,5,2,2,7,6,9

For a debut novel, it was a brilliant depiction of the most basic elements of fallen human nature--envy, greed, lust, deceit, all tied in with murder, emotional and sexual hunger, and obsession on a grander scale.I am thankful to my new favorite author, Paula Hawkins, for:1) Not giving us a Gone Girl ending, especially with all the main characters' aversion to truth. This type of unpredictability suited Gone Girl because of the utter vileness of the ''heroine,""and we know that life never turns out the way we want, and sometimes evil triumphs over good. But I think letting Rachel live and killing off Tom finally gave the reader some breathing room to say, ""Finally. Something goes right."" (Or at least that's what I say, given that I felt like I was reading the book on a fast-paced train with my pulse beating fast and heartbeat ricocheting in my chest.)2)Giving me a character I can relate to. Only instead of alcohol, I'm addicted to caffeine. I felt that Rachel Watson was somewhat of an extension of me. We're both curious, (need to know), we're both driven by a sense of doing what's right (if you see something, say something), although I don't know if I would have had the nerve to do what she did, we've both said our share of ""I'm sorry"" to people we love (after acting similarly), and we're both fat. Instant buddies for sure. Throughout the novel, she makes stupid decisions (just like I do), but I found myself feeling protective of her. I did not want her to meet Megan's fate. So thanks to Ms. Hawkins for giving me a new best friend.3). Writing a book with a potential for changing lives. At the core of this novel is this undeniable theme: We are all only humans. We have our successes, our failures. Our strengths, our weaknesses. We are individually different but together all the same. All of us have hope of redemption. Rachel was an alcoholic until she realized the value of memory over apologizing for things she doesn't remember. Anna liked being the homewrecker until she found out the train wreck her life had become with Tom's infidelity and her ex-nanny's betrayal. For some, redemption was too late. Megan and Tom wanted something they could not obtain in their own lives so they reached out to each other for a temporary pleasure, which inevitably costs them their lives. Though the reality of my life is nowhere nearly that drastic, I can honestly say that I am somewhat changed by the lessons in this novel. It has touched my heart in ways that only truly great literature can.Though I'm sad at the end of this journey and that I have to debark, I hope other readers will get the chance to ride this fast-paced thriller on wheels, accompanied by suspense and page-turning anticipation running through their fingertips.",12,17,12,15,17,15,11,19,23,33
"103",0.5,"I was so excited to finally read The Girl on the Train after hearing a plethora of positive reviews from both friends and critics. I love a good psychological thriller, and I hoped this would be no exception. As soon as I started reading the book I was sucked into the story. I couldn't stop turning pages, and I needed to find out what happened. Unfortunately, I guessed the outcome of the novel right from the beginning, and that really detracted from my enjoyment of the story.The Girl on the Train is the story of Rachel, a twenty-something alcoholic who still loves her ex-husband, despite the fact that he cheated on her and dumped her for the other woman. The book opens with Rachel taking the train every day. She makes up stories about the houses the train goes past on the way, and she loves watching a couple she deems as perfect. One day, the woman in the couple is with another man, and Rachel is quite upset about her cheating. The next day Rachel wakes up a mess after a night of drinking. She has very limited memories of her night, but it turns out the woman she watches from the train is now missing, and she is worried she might be connected to her disappearance in some way.The writing in this book is really well done and quite easy to read, too. I think this is a great novel for those of you who are not big readers, or perhaps you are transitioning from young adult to adult books. While the pacing is generally very quick, I did feel a bit bored during the middle of the book, when I felt like the action slowed down a bit. This is especially true, for me, in hindsight. Because I was able to predict the ending of the book right from the start, it rendered most of the novel moot. I felt like the author walked me around in circles when she could have walked me in a straight line.Nonetheless, I really appreciate the plethora of important issues discussed in The Girl on the Train. For example, Rachel's alcoholism stems from her inability to have children. It makes me so frustrated to think of how women are often deemed worthless if they are unable to have children, even in today's society where we are working so hard to achieve equality between the sexes. I felt so sad for Rachel, and wanted her to get help throughout the book. In fact, I really appreciate that all of the characters in The Girl on the Train are so flawed. I've seen many reviews in which readers criticize the author for writing only terrible characters. Yes, many of the characters in this book do horrible and deplorable things, but I see most of them as having redeemable qualities as well. Other important topics discussed in this book are mental illness, the role of women in society, whether you can really know someone, and when, if ever, can we find truth in life.Overall, The Girl on the Train was a fun read, and I'm glad I picked it up due to its popularity and film adaptation. I am a bit disappointed that the big twist at the end was so predictable, and that is the main reason why I am giving this three out of five stars. That being said, I think The Girl on the Train is the perfect book to read with friends because there are so many topics to be discussed. I will definitely check out any other books that Paula Hawkins writes in the future as well, since I did fly through this one!*This review originally posted on Goodreads",10,9,9,8,10,13,4,10,19,21
"104",1.8,"I was blown away by this psychological thriller, a debut psychological thriller at that! I was fascinated by the idea of this woman secretly spying on residents everyday as she rides the 8:04 train. People watching is fun, I enjoy doing it when I’m forced to be social, but the situation this woman involves herself in is far more complicated, and personal, than she expected. (And something I’m not motivated enough to involve myself with- bye Felicia.)Coming out of a rough divorce, Rachel finds herself at an all time low. She drinks to dull her emotional pain, she rides the train into town without a sense or purpose, and now she finds herself meddling in other’s peoples affairs- literally. As a former resident of Blenheim Road, she’s always watching as she passes by... Until one day, she sees something, within the blink of an eye, that kick starts an investigation she’s stuck in the middle of.Rachel begins her own personal investigation after the police have made it quite clear they won’t be listening to an unstable drunk. The case had me jumping to conclusions after each chapter. I wanted answers and wanted them now. I was desperate to read faster, to unlock another clue that would lead me in the right direction of solving the mystery.Hawkins wrote chapters from alternating points of view, revealing pertinent bits of information at the right moment. The minute I had an inkling on who the perpetrator could have been, something new was thrown into the equation and I’d be back to square one. Mad props on your trickster ways and skills, Paula.One of my favorite things about reading this genre is trying to figure out/solve the mystery before it’s revealed. (Movies, too!) It’s a trait I inherited from my dad. Books I can’t figure out/solve are always enjoyable; whether I’m reading and frantically turning pages as if they’re more important than air, or taking my time to absorb the details and take notes, they engulf me. Sleep is for the weak, I need answers.The Girl on the Train was a nail biter and I was hooked on the story the entire time. I look forward to future works by this author!",4,10,3,8,3,6,3,8,12,13
"105",0.8,"""My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination...""And with that, Rachel the narrator certainly becomes one of the most unreliable narrators I've ever had the pleasure of reading. There are actually several points of view in 'The Girl on the Train' but Rachel is the main narrator. A sad sack of a woman, she has been recently divorced, fired from her job in London and is losing a nasty battle with the bottle. Because she is often drunk, nothing she says or recalls is trustworthy.I needed a break from my usual contemporary romances and this thriller kept me glued to my Kindle! Rachel sees a ""prefect couple"" from the train every day, and she concocts an elaborate fantasy life for them. Surely they must live a perfect life! Unlike her, they seem to live a charmed life, sitting in their pretty garden every day, sipping coffee together.""I don’t know their names, either, so I had to name them myself. Jason, because he’s handsome in a British film star kind of way, not a Depp or a Pitt, but a Firth, or a Jason Isaacs. And Jess just goes with Jason, and it goes with her. It fits her, pretty and carefree as she is. They’re a match, they’re a set. They’re happy, I can tell. They’re what I used to be, they’re Tom and me five years ago. They’re what I lost, they’re everything I want to be.""Slowly we realize that in fact NOTHING in this book is as it seems, and Rachel is soon drawn into a frightening situation about which, sadly for her, she has no memory. On top of everything else, Rachel is constantly morose and sad, depressed about the loss of her beloved husband Tom, and begins to drive everyone away who ever cared about her.""Beautiful sunshine, cloudless skies, no one to play with, nothing to do. Living like this, the way I’m living at the moment, is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight, so little cover of darkness, when everyone is out and about, being flagrantly, aggressively happy. It’s exhausting, and it makes you feel bad if you’re not joining in.""Rachel drinks so much that she begins to black out. She stalks her ex-husband and his new wife Anna but just can't seem to stop herself.""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""This book takes many twists and turns and nothing at all is at it seems. Just when I thought I knew where the story was going, it veered off into another place entirely. it is smart, perfectly paced and filled with flawed, all-too-human characters. Even though Rachel is COMPLETELY unlikable, I was cheering for her throughout the book.'The Girl on the Train' is smart, clever and surprising. Glad I read it before I saw the movie.

"106",3.15,"I admit that I’m no expert when it comes to this genre. In fact, as to date, I have only read three books including this that falls under this category, so I will have to base my review on the general impact of the novel to me to the best of my ability.In my personal opinion, this book passes the mystery-thriller-suspense-crime criteria with flying colors! What makes me say this has a great deal to do with the hypnotic writing style of the author- there is something eerie but magnetic with it and it is a huge mystery to me how the author is able to put across layers of meanings in the simplest thoughts and the most mundane phrases the female characters who are also the narrators utter.It is also noteworthy how the author, in order to craft this forbidding tale, deftly chose these three women who are most flawed and most foolish and yet are unexplainably capable of receiving the reader’s empathy. Of the three POV’s, I was most glued to that of Rachel’s (the major character) whose loneliness seems to magnify her imagination which consequently becomes the core of the plot.It is also quite impressively baffling that the plot seems both linear and rounded at the same time. I felt like nothing happens so much but at the same time, it also felt like everything is happening and unraveling right under my nose and I couldn’t control my heart from hammering against my chest. There were times I had to stop reading and allow the creeps to surface above my skin.",2,5,1,4,2,1,4,7,4,16
"107",0.65,"Although I understand the process of jumping around on time frames in this book it seemed a little more bewildering than some others I have read. In fact for the first hundred pages I really had a hard time getting into the story because Rachel was so pathetic that she was hard to even root for. This does not mean she was not a well-developed character nor does it mean the book was poorly written. I simply had a hard time identifying with any of the characters and it may be because the author was attempting to use Rachel's black periods as a device to make you question what really happened. About two-thirds of the way through the book I had determined who I believed killed Megan so the only thing left to do was to see who lived who died and who went to jail. The finale of the book was well done and feel true to form. I appreciate the story and I always enjoy a mystery but this book did not grab me as much as some others I have read recently. I still think many people would really enjoy reading the book and of course it would make a wonderful movie as has already been done. I simply believe that there are other books that do suspense better than this one although this is a fun read and I cannot say I was disappointed by it. Some of it just felt like it had been done before and in some cases better. As you can see I still believe it was a 4 out of 5 and therefore worth the time to read.

"109",1.85,"The Girl on the Train fits into what I call ""junkfood literature"" - not gonna change your life, but it's a fun, easy read.  The writing is good.

Although it was entertaining and fresh, it was depressing and left me just, well . . . depressed.  If you don't mind that, give it a chance.  I won't count Paula Hawkins out for future books.  The ending even left a bit of room for a possible sequel.",2,5,1,3,3,2,3,2,4,4
"111",3.2,"Ok, here's the deal. When a person takes the time and puts in the effort to write a book they automatically get at least 3 stars from me. Now, she is a good writer as far as the technical aspects go and she is fine with the creative elements as well, so I push it to 4 stars. However, I just wasn't terribly moved emotionally or mentally in any new way to give her 5 stars. To get 5 stars you really need to go the distance. You really need to stand out above the crowd with originality and creativity. you really need to move me and to shake me and/or alter my perception or change or challenge my way of thinking or something out of the same old same old, even if I don't like a book for other reasons I can give 5 stars if the author pushes my buttons or gets under my skin. This book does not go the distance. However it is a worthy read in a world of mediocrity that we have today because readers want to be catered to like little babies. Readers are few and lazy today. None of them want to really be challenged. Thus what is ok passes for quality because the lame mainstream readers out there demand to not have their boats rocked except moderately.

The characters do the same thing over and over and the dialogue repeats itself (""you have to stop this""). The way the author uses multiple narrators should provide more depth and intrigue than it actually does, since quite often it turns into each character saying more or less the same thing about the same incident.I know this book is a huge hit and now a movie starring the lovely Emily Blunt.

Too often, people pass up good novels or, as seen out here, condemn a good work because the characters are either not relatable or not what they wish they could relate too. Paula Hawkins does a great job in presenting a cast of characters that are flawed and present us with a sense of real life depression. Girl on the Train is often compared to Gillian Flynn's novels like Gone Girl. The difference between the two is that Flynn deliberately presents the reader with characters that are the dregs of society living in the bleakest of circumstances. Hawkins is less severe.With Girl on the Train, you get to know the murderer nearly from the first chapter. She cleverly hands the information to the reader and then equally cleverly expects you to dismiss it. And you will. You get to meet the three graces: Rachel, Anna and Megan. Each presents the story from her point of view. Rachel is the main character who's a seriously disturbed alcoholic with blackouts that start the mystery. Oddly, I found Rachel to be the only character worth knowing and caring about and most of that comes from her confusion as to who she is. You meet Megan next who struggles with sexual boundaries, or more likely borderline personality disorder. She's our lovely victim....and you won't care. Then you meet Anna who has supplanted Rachel in the heart of Tom, former husband, for supposedly being a better choice. Some people have suggested that Anna became pregnant and that's why Tom left Rachel but the timeline doesn't fit. Anna, just happens to be the narcissist who warps reality to fit her needs no matter how ridiculous.So with our three graces come all their flaws, a murder, odd characters hovering on the edges and something not quite right seen through Rachel's eyes. Though condemned for her lack of reliability and serious issues with judgment, Rachel actually does some extraordinary things which made me care. I won't say more other than this is worth reading, if you're a deep person and like to explore the possibility of ""what if this were me?"" If not, don't bother.",7,8,3,6,5,6,7,7,11,18
"115",1.75,"I bought this book mainly because it had been #1 NYTimes best-seller.  Big mistake.  I regret the time I wasted reading it.The vast majority of the plot energy centers around the female protagonists triumphantly discovering, verifying, agonizing over, and obsessing over the infidelity of their husbands. There is not one word about any attempts to solve problems or make a better marriage. There is not one word about the good side of any marriage.. On the contrary,If this bleep is to be believed, the only propose of marriage is lose-lose to give e the wife cause to feel bigtime aggrieved.  If that were the case, women's best course would always be to avoid marriage altogetherThat said, Hawkins weaves  in a powerful and non-preachy.anti-alcohol subtext.  If this book saves one young woman from life-destroying ravages of drink, that would be terrific.  But a good read it is not.",5,5,4,7,5,7,3,6,10,8
"117",2.75,"I picked up this book because I saw previews for the movie coming out. With it coming out soon, I burned through the book in a couple of sittings to keep it fresh in my mind. It was a pretty good read for me. The quality of writing is perfectly fine – never felt confused about what the author was trying to convey. The plot leaves a little to be desired. I think my liking of the book is somewhere between “its okay” and “I like it”. My main issues with the story are as follows:1. The book doesn’t really get into the meat of the story until about halfway. I kept waiting for something to happen but it always seemed to be coming eventually.2. The book is only told from the POV of the women – Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Tom, Scott, and to a lesser extent Megan’s shrink, do not get a chapter to themselves. I assume this is done because if they had, there would be no mystery. I’m not sure if this is lazy writing, but it certainly makes the narrative a little biased.3. The author spends the entire book basically saying that the killer can’t possibly be a certain character and then at the end of the book – SURPRISE! – it is. That is not really a twist by my definition.4. When you do find out who the killer is, everything wraps up in the last 20 pages and the story is over. I wasn’t expecting any sort of slasher killer fake ending with the murderer constantly popping up, but after the reveal the book just rockets to the end and doesn’t let anything sink in for the reader.Despite the issues I had, I still enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it. It is interesting to read from Rachel’s POV because you can see her mind unravel at times and you can’t trust some things she says. Give it a read, or maybe just check out the movie, but don’t expect it to change your life.",1,7,2,4,4,2,4,9,7,12
"118",6.95,"I have mixed feelings about this book. It was good, but it wasn't quite as good as I expected based on all the hype. The writing style was pretty straight forward and simple. In many people's opinion, simple writing is better and it certainly stayed away from the purple prose. So it points for that. Still it wasn't beautifully written. The story was told from the viewpoint of three female characters and it is a murder mystery sort of novel. Much of the book deals with characters reflecting back while not being able to piece together who committed the murder. The book isn't very long and is a book that someone can read fairly quickly. I like books that I can read in a night, so this is a plus to me. At times it felt like the book was dragging though as it kind of left us wondering without much movement in the plot. Since the main event already happened, there was a lot of /waiting to find out/ about the storyline. The main character (the girl on the train) was a decent character.  Rachel is an alcoholic with blackouts, an inability to have children and at her core a heart of gold. The story was also written from the viewpoint of Anna, the more slender, more beautiful and more fertile girl who hooked up with Rachel's husband while they were still married and later married him herself. Anna is sort of the typical /bitchy other woman/ who eventually admits that didn't really care that she taking a married man. The story was also told from the viewpoint of a the pretty blonde Megan who cheats on her husband and has a troubled past. The female characters were interesting. The book goes into the nature of a manipulative relationships and could be a helpful read to woman who have gone through domestic violence or tend to fall for bad guys.",3,6,2,3,5,5,3,6,7,16
"119",1.2,"I had added ""Girl On a Train"" to my summer reading list, and was anxious to start it.  It was high on my list - right after Orphan Train and All the Light We Cannot See. I had no preconceived ideas about it and did not know the story line. Given the number of great reviews, I was pretty shocked when I was halfway through it and simply not engaged. I could have put it down and not returned to it. I get the theme of ""these-characters-aren't-who-you-think-they-are"", but how many chapters of the main character's obsessive screw ups, alcoholism, mental instability,  and self-loathing do we need to witness before thinking the author doubts our comprehension and needs to repeat it for us?For awhile, the most interesting part for me was the momentary supposition that Megan and Rachel were the same person due to MPD - at the same time knowing the impossibility of that considering the cross-over of people in both their lives. By the time the author fleshed out Meghan's background issues - I just didn't care. It had taken too long and I just didn't care to pick up the [new] baggage of Meghan's self-loathing after spending half the book watching Rachel embrace her pathetic-ness.I don't know if one would consider it a ""disclaimer"" but I have a degree in Criminology, so I may be more pragmatic in my attitude. I read a lot of mystery/thrillers and feel I am easily engaged and don't tend to over criticize.With that said, (and trying to avoid spoilers) - I thought the perpetrator was obvious early on, based on actions and history......not conversation and pretenses.  And come on - the ""nanny scenario??""  Seriously""Normally, in a thriller or mystery I really like - the characters are woven with a complexity that involves me.

"120",3.1,"Whenever each of us reads a book, consciously - or unconsciously -  our reactions to the story, the characters, the writing  all affected by what we  to the story. My own reading experience was quite disturbing, so much so that the psychological, emotional abuse of my past marriage was triggered in ways that stunned and frightened me.  Proust was either lucky or fanciful with the charming memories triggered by his famous madeleine cookies.  This novel is suspenseful and fast paced.  It is also a subtle and complex story about women -  women's experiences and desires within the context of Western culture: how women live with men - or ,in this story, a man - about how we come to believe ""truths"" about ourselves.  The story can be read in many ways: suspenseful murder mystery; fast paced psychological mystery; and also as a story about a complex main character -  weak  and unlikeable when first introduced - and her relationships within the other women's stories.  As this tale is unwoven by the author, we find the main character caught up in a plausible tale about the fallout from lies and the (too often invisible) psychological and emotional abuse women endure silently, frequently without self-awareness, leaving these characters with few skills to ""see"" the truth.

The girl on the train, Rachel, is an alcoholic and watches a couple on her commute who live on the same street she previously did with her ex husband.  When the woman in the couple goes missing she tries to figure out what happened, and if she was nearby that night due to her continued stalking of her ex hubby.  We get repeated mentions of:- let's call my hubby to help me remember (3-4 times), or just showing up on the street multiple times- going to the underpass beneath the train tracks (3x or so)- trying to find another commuter who interacted with her that night (3-4 times)- trying to contact the husband of the missing women, stalking him tooIt improves toward the end, when we finally don't have the repeated chapters over and over again.

I surmised the major plot twist about 1/3 of the way through the book, but kept thinking I might be missing something.  I wasn't.  As other reviewers have stated, the characters are mildly likeable but tend to border more on the annoying.  Their lives, as described by the three various narrators, were uninteresting.  There were many parts of the narrations that could have gone in a compelling direction and would draw you in, but those tangents were often simple, short and left you feeling as if the book was written simple to get to the end.  It was an okay read - definitely a sit by the beach to read the mundane type of book.",2,3,1,2,4,3,1,3,4,8
"153",5.2,"Interesting premise, decent execution. A refreshing change to have 3 main female protagonists who all have warts (although nothing in comparison to the males). The ""multiple viewpoint first person"" narrative (I'm sure there's a more technical literary name for this) is an interesting conceit but a bit confusing at first. In my view, the  story could have been told just as effectively by only two of the 3 narrators. Also one thing that gets missed in this format is any broader descriptive detail and explicit point of view on the evolution of modern British suburban society that lends itself to the rise of twits like these people (since only one of the 3 female narrators --and none of their 2 dimensional male counterparts--will admit to being twits as part of their narrative)The story itself could actually take place anywhere; needn't have been the Home Counties in the UK. However, compared to the mindlessness of the post-yuppie suburban twits we have in the US, these UK versions are pretty soft-edged, maybe even tolerable neighbors. Maybe I'll emigrate.The intersection of the personal narrative of the ""main"" protagonist and the mystery she's drawn into means there are inevitable missed turns on the plot roadmap. At one point I was flipping back through earlier pages thinking I'd either missed something or had inherited the heroine's propensity for drunken blackouts. Had this been a movie we would've commented ""hmmm, guess the last half of THAT plot line ended up on the cutting room floor.""All that aside, this was a decent read and a good diversion. I look forward to reading her next effort. also look forward to what I assume will be the inevitable film version of ""girl on a train"", which I think could actually rectify some of the plotting and narrative blind spots of the book. ) This book is being marketed as ""the next Gone Girl"", but in the right hands, I think a film version of this book could be so much stronger than Gone girl, which I thought had all the predictability of ritual Kabuki theater but with a suspenseful soundtrack.",2,4,2,3,2,2,4,4,5,14
"154",3.25,"I was looking for another great thriller after loving Gone Girl, and since this was just released as a feature film I wanted to read the book before I see the movie. Unfortunately I did not feel that it lived up the hype. Not a single one of the characters is very likeable, so it's hard to care about what about happens to them, or feel invested in the story. For a split second (about 3/4 of the way through the book), it got interesting and the mystery started to feel intriguing, but after all the build-up the final few chapters flew by fairly predictably.There is a lot of flipping back and forth between the characters telling the story, which was kind of similar to Gone Girl, but each section is written in the same style so it doesn't really seem like you're reading another person's perspective. And each section is dated, again copied from Gone Girl, but many of them are out of sequence so I found myself flipping back several times to figure out the timeline.All in all, it was just okay. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. And I don't have much of a desire to see the movie anymore.",1,2,1,1,4,1,1,4,3,9
"155",3.15,"I'm not sure how many stars to give this book.  It is ""very British"" meaning not an American voice, references that resonate with UK citizens made me look up words.Perhaps the fact that I am American, pragmatically American, I did not connect with any of the characters. Not even the baby was described in a way that made me smile; whining, grizzing, no cooing or cuddles really.The characters are self involved and yet not evolved as human beings, which, I suppose is usually the case.The mystery is very good.  It is a true twisting tale of human craziness.  Maybe like the classic Of Human Bondage.Upon reading the last page, I felt sad, not hopeful. I don't think that the character arc was complete but as this is a mystery,perhaps it is keeping in its kind.The other thing that I thought was,""this author is messed up."". But I am middle aged, not raised in the cable tv extremes that millennials, etc have been inured to since birth.

"156",0.7,"I read this book with my book club. I was intrigued by the promise of unreliable narrators, because they are a weakness of mine. If you don't care for those, or feel cheated or lied to when you read that sort of thing, you'll want to skip this one. I was also interested by people comparing the author to Gillian Flynn. There are definite similarities. I think if you like one,  you'll like the other.I suppose this book would be considered a psychological thriller, Or a murder mystery, but I'm not very good at identifying the right categories for these things. I do recall, after years of watching shows like Bones and Monk, that you can identify the killer by spotting the unnecessary character. In those TV shows, that always works. In this book, I thought I had done that, but it turned out I was wrong. And I was pleased by the red herring. Again, unreliable narrators make that difficult to find. So, don't expect this to be easy to figure out right away.The story is very dark. I think it manages to be less dark than Gillian Flynn's books, but not by much. There are three narrators. Rachel is who I would consider to be the main character. She is a divorcee with a drinking problem, prone to drunken blackouts, unable to remember what happens during them. She's also one of the only likable characters in the book. With all of her flaws she still manages to be sympathetic. It can be hard for the reader not to root for her, even while cringing at a lot of her choices.The book was engaging from the very beginning, with the story drawing you in and keeping you there, because you'll want to know what happens next.

I am 70 so my memory really isn't that good, so at first I wrote the characters names down and a bit of a description of them. I referred to it after I was forced to put my book down and do some dang work. I would quickly review my notes and just like that I was back into my story. ( I. Loved. Every. Moment. Of. This.

I do have a complaint about the people here telling too many details about the story.

Megan reads as a self-centered, conniving, bish, although she has a revelation of such profound and utter sadness that my heart sank to the pit of my stomach for several hours (getting into a book brings the characters alive for me; they are temporarily people that 'I know').  Anna both revels in gloating satisfaction and plays the weak victim at the same time.  Cathy is a roommate with a level of patience that doesn't seem believable.  Tom and Scott, even when they aren't doing anything 'wrong', both seem like condescending jerks to me.I feel like I am 'supposed' to like this book, because someone liked it well enough to turn it into a major motion picture, but I can't quite give it a glowing review.I will say that the author did a decent job of keeping the twists and turns easy enough to follow.

It would be impossible to lump any character into a category of either ""good"" or ""bad,"" as (with all humans) each is a complex combination of both.

And, unfortunately, in my opinion, despite Ms. Blount being very attractive, I don't  believe from what I saw from the trailer, she could have accurately portrayed Rachel totally.  However, what I enjoyed about this author's style is that she captured what I feel  is essential to writing mysteries:  make every word and story element count!!  The reader wants to collect information about people, places and things.  We don't like unnecessary story angles that go on and on or ridiculous love stories that have no bearing on the case.

"187",4.2,"I hated the book. How much? Well, this book pissed me off because I just couldn't finish the damn thing. I read about 45% of it and put it down for a few weeks hoping I could start it fresh and become more engaged in the story than I was during the first half. I was irritated because I have rarely walked away from even the most boring, tedious tale.I'm a reader, 60, educated and a male. This doesn't put me in the target audience. But I could have enjoyed the ride if it just moved along a little or if ALL the characters weren't petty, self absorbed basket cases. Their responses to what befalls them each individually seems trite and/or illogical to a fault. I wanted to throw the Kindle across the room as Rachel stumbles along on what is either a quest to solve a mystery or a road to redemption. That was about 70% of the way through the book. But the straw that broke the camel's back came when I realized that we're getting narration of past events from a character whom, by all rights, shouldn't be able to do that. And that's as close to a spoiler as I'm willing to get.Obviously I'm in a minority group of dissenters here and granted. For the folks that love this story, more power to you, your money was well invested. Also, I'll grant the writer due credit for skill in structure and character development but I found the whole thing boring, boring and a snooze. I had no sympathy or empathy for a single character in this book. Nasty, nasty people with nary a redeeming quality between them. If they were at least interesting...",3,7,2,2,5,5,2,6,10,18
"189",7.5,"I wish I liked this one more. It is an interesting concept with the alternating chapters between characters, the vague narration, the mystery of a woman's disappearance, the train travel. But for me the good parts did not outweigh the boring or less than stellar parts.My feelings in short: Engaging beginning, boring middle, exciting ending.My main problems were:1. Writing style. It was waaaaaaay too much internal dialogue. Some is totally okay. We all think in our heads or talk to ourselves. But I hate excessive internal dialogue, and in the case of this story it was a lot. So for me, this was a major issue. Now, if you like internal dialogue, you may very well love this book. But I personally need more character interactions; more showing, less telling, please.2. Characters. I also didn't like any of these characters, except for Rachel's roommate (who was dismissed for being nice). Rachel, Anna, and Megan are the narrators, and I found my interest in them waning. Having an alcoholic for a main narrator was interesting to start, then super annoying. Tom and Scott were no better. These people all had issues galore, which usually makes for an intriguing read. But unfortunately, even with their issues, I lost my interest in them.3. Repetitive. I was pretty engaged in the first 30% or so. Basically until I figured out the twist. Then I was waiting for the characters to catch up with me. Then I was bored. It was lie, get drunk, blackout; rinse and repeat. Once I knew what was coming (maybe not the details, but the main idea), I felt like maybe 100 pages of the book could have been removed due to sheer repetitiveness, and it would have been fine with me. Living in an alcoholic haze with Rachel became tedious. The saving grace was the ending. At least it left me on a high note.On the positive side, I read this book for my book club, and I was in the minority on my feelings toward it. The other women either liked or loved it. So this book got a 5/6 approval rating from us. No one else in my book club figured out the twist, either, so they were far more engaged than I was. Perhaps if I hadn't figured out the twist at 30% I would have liked it more, too. Oh well.Would I recommend this book? Sure. If you like a book with mystery and odd characters, and don't mind a lot of internal dialogue, this might just be the book for you.",4,7,2,4,7,5,4,6,11,17

"201",5.3,"The Girl on the Train is a perfect primer for women who still believe the man they fall in love with is responsible for their happily ever after. The story is narrated by three women--Rachel, wife #1, Anna, wife # 2, and Megan, the new prospect. All are involved with one man, Tom, in an overlapping sequence of events. It so happens that Tom is perfect for all three of the women at the beginning of each relationship because he is masterful at giving each what they need. Therefore, each woman fails to see that Tom becomes manipulative and controlling. But as each relationship falters, all three women expect Tom to make it better. Unfortunately for them, Tom's idea of improving a bad relationship is to move on to a new one--which becomes a problem that hits Tom squarely when Megan, the new woman he is involved with, decides to no longer be manipulated. When she threatens to take control from him, life as each woman knew it spirals out of control.This novel is a worthy read because it shows how easy it is for some women to willingly give up control of their happiness to the man who promises them love forever. In the case of the women in this story, their unhappiness involves so much whining and drinking that it's hard to like any of them. However, Rachel does redeem herself when she starts to realize Tom has manipulated her to a level that shows he is dangerous and capable of much worse. Tom is the anatomy of a perfect psychopath, and the author leaves enough unsaid about Tom until the reader puts it all together. This book is a must for women who still believe in the fairy tale prince!",1,3,1,5,4,6,1,7,8,17
"202",3.45,"I read this book without reading any reviews, because there is always some (selfish) person who gives away too much of the story, or who (selfishly) shares the ending.  So I went in not knowing how the story was narrated or how the dates changed.  This is how I would recommend reading this book.I loved it!Yes, the characters can be frustrating, but I loved how each character stood on their own........until they didn't. I loved how the characters were developed little by little, especially Rachel.  I will say, it took me a few pages to decide I liked the book, but once I got into it, I had a hard time putting it down.  I found I was reading quickly because I needed to see what happened, but then I was going back and re-reading to fully take it all in.  I don't use the Highlight feature on my kindle much, but I used it a lot in this story.When it all starts to come together, when you start to see the time-line connections, when you start to feel like the ending is right around the corner.........it's not, and I loved that!  I am one of those people who watches too many crime dramas and the who-done-it is rarely a surprise, but this book kept me turning the page until all was revealed.  My only complaint about this book might be the somewhat quick wrap-up on the final two or three pages.  I wanted to know more, I wanted to know what happens to them all now.

This would seem to indicate that it is an easy read, which it is. Each chapter is devoted to a particular date over a three year period, switching between characters. I read the Kindle version and found it hard to keep track of the dates, although this is a deficiency in the Reader rather than in the Author.  I would have preferred to read the hard copy version for this reason. The story moves smoothly and the author cleverly keeps the reader guessing as to the outcome, although she drops a clue, whether intentional or not, about a quarter of the way from the end.  For this reason I found the last, inevitable, scene somewhat drawn out, but this is a minor quibble only. I have not seen the film but I imagine it makes quite good cinema and/or TV.

"208",4.6,"Well, I'm just a regular reader, no professional reviewer or anything, but I have a lot to say about this amazing book.This ingenius novel is a fascinating look at how everybody is very different, everybody is a little similar, and those similarities and differences can twist together in amazing ways in the end.The characters are very human, being both likable and, at the same time, people we can't help but look down on.  But the characters' complexity emerges as the book gets further along, so that before you know it, you've been guilty of character assassination when you shouldn't have been.  You've been rooting for things you shouldn't have been.  You've been caught up in things in all the wrong ways.  And it happened to you right under your own nose.This book is a great ride! Twisting, turning, pulling you around.  I am an avid reader, and even I was surprised.By the time the ending is approaching, a moral has actually formed in your mind.  You don't even realize it because you've had such a good time.

"209",1.25,"I did not enjoy this book at all.  Chapters are written from the perspective of one character at a time and the timing jumps all over the place.  The story is told from over the course of 3 years but jumps back and forth during that time and is not well written.  This is not a book that is suspenseful as portrayed by the synopsis.  Things that are mentioned and you think they will play a part in the book just disappear, never to be referenced again.  I had figured out who the bad guy was very early on in the book.  And the main character, Rachel, just makes you want to grab her by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.  If you like to read about weak women that can easily be lead by men, then by all means, read the book.

There are a fair amount of characters and the book is written from the point of view of multiple characters, but it is easily identified who is speaking and it is written chronologically so it is still easy to understand. Some twists, enough to keep you interested and not wanting to put it down. Reminded me of Gone Girl a little bit with the story and the style of writing. I liked it better than Gone Girl for sure, but gone girl was a bit more surprising to me. Overall a good book, nothing that I would list in my top 10 favorites, but I also wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it either. I would recommend reading it before seeing the movie because the book is better (as always) but the movie wasn't bad either.

Imagine taking a handful of broken characters from an assortment of soap operas and jumbling them together.  This might be the result.  I must look at the publishing house.  I will use extra caution before buying from them again.  I did find this book on a suggested reading list, so someone liked it, but certainly not this reader.

When I finally took it out,  I thought it was kind of confusing and depressing at that. All I can say is, hang on and keep reading through about the first 60 pages or so or until you just HAVE to know more about what drives these characters!  There is a lot of internal dialogue that goes on that I would think would be completely missed in the film format. You will get to know what makes these characters tick, which in itself is extremely interesting and entertaining. After you get through the first tough beginning and begin to know who's who in the zoo, prepare not to get any sleep until the story ends.

"215",0.55,"""The Girl on the Train” is a debut psychological thriller by Paula Hawkins who was a journalist for fifteen years before she turned her hand to fiction.  The setting of the novel is in London during the summer told through three female voices: Rachel, Megan and Anna.The protagonist, Rachel Watson is an alcoholic who witnesses a murder while on a commuter train.  However, because of her inability to remember things, her constant blackouts and incapability to separate fact from fiction; makes others not believe that she saw a murder.  Even though she has problems with staying sober and focused, Rachel is persistent in trying to find out what happened and why.I feel this is a good debut book for those that like psychological thrillers.  Ms. Hawkins has a good writing style even though I felt the action did not really take off until about the last 75 pages of the book. My deltas are I hated every character in the book because they seemed to not have any redeeming values and worked hard to hurt everyone they knew.  Furthermore, the story dragged in the middle and the ending seemed a little too pat.Overall, it had a good story line and I felt it may change how we look at the lives of others we encounter daily.

"216",1.65,"From page one this book grabbed my attention and held on until the very end. It has been awhile since I read a book this fast. I loved the way it was presented from the points of view of the three female characters. Nothing is quite as it appears. What we perceive from a distance can be very different from the reality. I was drawn into the complex lives of each of these women and ultimately how they were all connected. The fact that the story is somewhat dark and moody only made it more intriguing for me. I loved the writing, the depth of the female characters, especially Rachel, and how easily I could ""see"" each scene in my mind. Having heard mixed reviews about this book, I didn't rush to read it, but scenes from the newly released movie made me curious and I heard that some liked the movie better than the book. Needless to say now that I read and loved the book, I definitely want to see the movie. One of the best well-written books I have read in quite awhile.",1,1,0,0,0,2,0,3,1,5
"217",0.95,"I read this book in almost a matter of hours. I became interested when I saw that this book would be made into a movie, and when I heard from friends how great and thrilling it was. I love reading, but I am a very visual person and if the words don't make me feel like I am actually there, experiencing everything like I was actually there, I have a harder time getting through. I was on the edge of my seat, and my heart ached for the main character... couldn't he see what he was doing to her? Why didn't he understand? Why was she having to suffer through this almost completely alone? Who did it?The little hints that Paula Hawkins drops to foreshadow the twisted events at the end are so subtle yet set the mood in a terrifyingly gut-wrenching way that makes you wish you could jump into the book screaming. The imagery was incredible and the descriptions strung together like poetry. I could smell the alcohol on her breath, I could feel the train moving, I could feel her despair. The character development is so deep, that you can't help but love and hate each and every character.It has a ""Gone Girl"" feel with its own unique flair and psychological twist, with an ending you won't see coming.",5,3,6,3,3,3,2,0,6,8
"218",4.65,"I read _Girl on a Train_ since I knew that the film of the same name was based on the Hawkins' novel. The author's style of writing and structure, with main characters offering differing perspectives of the same events, was v similar to the genre of postmodern ""woman in distress"" novels represented best by _Gone Girl_.  As in _Gone Girl_, Hawkins presents us w a femme fatale (or two perhaps) who may or may not have precipitated their own disappearance or dissolution--or salvation. _Girl on a Train_ is a masterful psychological thriller. The novel develops well developed  characters whose outlines come into focus through, among other things, razor sharp dialogue and merciless introspection. What I also found particularly enjoyable about the novel was Hawkins' slow emergence of a short London suburban street and endlessly looping train as a character in its own right, both a geographical and psychological site of cultural and personal imprisonment.",3,1,2,5,2,3,2,5,4,6

So many people insisted it was the best book they had read this year, so I finally just hunkered down and dug in. The story is captivating enough, so I imagine that that was a big part of what the fuss is all about. And a female alcoholic protagonist is a new twist on the old unreliable narrator. My problem was that I didn't care for the characters. Not that I disliked them, they just left me cold. Plus, it was pretty easy for me to see where the story was headed, about half way through the book. I read on, hoping for a more interesting plot twist, but when the reveal came, it was unrealistic the way that the perpetrator just came right out and blurted all the details of the murder. So, why 4 stars? Because I'm impressed by all the hoopla have and every time an author attracts the kind of readership that encourages others to pick up a book, I put my own subjective opinion aside, to a degree.

It's almost distracting. But overall, I'm not mad that I spent the time reading this book. It's not amazing though, I'm a little surprised that it made multiple best-seller lists. And surprised that they made a movie out of it (which is not even as good as the book... don't bother seeing after reading the book, the movie actually does a WORSE job of telling the story).

I'd send you my copy but I already mailed it to a friend so they don't have to buy one.",2,5,1,2,3,2,3,4,7,11
"244",5.4,"It took me about 6-8 months before I wanted to read this book.  I asked several people I saw reading the book what they thought and a lot of people said it was just OK.  When I started this book I almost put it right back down.  I did not like the authors writing style.  It was choppy.  After about 2 chapters I was hooked.  Although the style is choppy throughout, this book held my interest totally.  I enjoyed the story, I enjoyed all the characters, and I could feel emotion with each one.  I felt she developed the characters beautifully.  Normally I don't like this jumping back and forth between characters but in this case it was totally necessary to get a total view of what each character was feeling.  I thought the ending was not as great as the rest of the book but it was by no means a deal breaker.  I would highly recommend this book.",1,3,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,6
"245",2.45,"It appears that I am in the minority, giving this novel 3 stars. Readers either love it or hate it. Which is fine, and is the  purpose of having reviews published. When you find reviewers who seem to like the same books you do, you're more inclined to consider other books they liked- that's all. No better, no worse, just different.So, on to the three star rating: This was a light summer read. I personally did not care for the author's style of writing nor how she presented the plot. There was too much focus, I thought, on how much and in what ways, Rachel got drunk, for example.  I got it. She's a raging alcoholic. No need to elaborate on each of the many incidents. And some of the events seemed just too unbelievable. As if someone could sneak into your home, drunk, take your baby while you sleep next to her, then run outside with her and not wind up in jail on attempted kidnapping charges!In addition, I wasn't crazy about the author's style of writing. If you haven't read the novel: each chapter is presented from the point of view of one of the 3 female characters, written in the first person. I began to notice that each started to sound like the others; same way of speaking, even the same expressions, at times. I found it difficult to differentiate among them, since they sounded the same. And since they are all deeply flawed, they needed more character development in order for the reader to find something redeemable about any of them. The reader needs something to hang on to- empathy, sympathy, relate ability- in order to care about a character. I didn't find this to be the case.Perhaps some of my disappointment here lies in the fact that I had just finished All The Light We Cannot See. Beautifully written and developed. Talk about caring for the characters... wow.I am not sorry that I read the book. It is a quick, somewhat entertaining read. Not something you have to dedicate part of your life to. And I can see why it has its share of devoted fans. Even if I am not among them.",5,4,3,9,6,8,1,4,11,14
"246",2.35,"(2.5 stars) Highly overrated, less sophisticated version of Gone Girl:It was an easy read and I was intrigued by the premise of the plot, but this book is highly overrated. Most of the characters are so unlikeable and disingenuous, it's almost laughable. I truly didn't care what happened to any of the characters. The story lacked suspense and I feel like the answer to the mystery was obvious 2/3 of the way through. Overall, it reminded me of a less sophisticated Gone Girl. (I had mixed feelings about Gone Girl, but I appreciated the story's dark psychology and attention to detail).",0,2,2,1,0,1,2,1,2,2
"247",0.7,"I purchased this book because of the raving reviews. Many said this was the next Gone Girl. However, I found this novel very difficult to read for several reasons. First, there are many perspectives and many time lines happening during the book that I wasn't paying true attention to until about a quarter of the way through. For ex. One perspective takes place Fri in Aug while in a few pages the next perspective takes place Fri in June. The second reason I found this novel difficult to get through is the main character. She is a drunk that I had a hard time empathetizing with. Character development was extremely slow. Half these chapters didn't even need to exist. I felt as if she was just nonstop whining about her life, being drunk, and hating her life. Not a pleasurable read in the least bit.I tried several times putting the book down and starting it back up again in a few days but I just couldn't finish it. I like to read for enjoyment. If I wanted to read about a drunk who couldn't keep a job I would just go on Facebook.",2,2,0,3,3,0,1,1,2,6
"248",3.6,"I did enjoy this book -- it's a quick read and the plot does hold one's attention. It's also refreshing to have a narrator (there are several, but Rachel seems to be the primary one) who is not especially likable; it's a change of pace from the norm.But there were a lot of things about ""The Girl on the Train"" that nagged at me. Yes, it's a thriller, but it went deeper and deeper into implausibility as it proceeded, and I felt like the whole thing could have been wrapped up 50 pages sooner. Rachel's decline, while realistic, also strains credulity a bit -- I will not spoil things, but I felt the supporting characters would not have let her go so far.I would give the book four stars but for one key failing: Every woman in this book is defined entirely by her relationship with men. Being in relationships, being mothers, being loved and ""cared for"" -- that's all that seems to matter to them. (And the men are boorish, smug cads.) One might not seek complexity in a book like this, but I was surprised by the misogyny.",1,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,5,5
"249",2.65,"I generally try to use reviews to choose what I wish to read in part. After reading a few reviews, I kind of knew what I was getting into. I did not expect the tone of the book to be what it was though. It was dark, somewhat twisted- no, I mean a lot twisted. The characters all had personal demons. Wading through the trough of the harsh lives, cheating and treachery of the characters, I tried to see a thread of where Ms. Hawkins was taking the story. Brushing the fumes of alcohol aside and the blackout laden plot, I started to have my own theories build. The theories waxed and waned. I solved the mystery 4 or 5 times before enough detail became evident to reason it out. It was a good effort on Hawkin's part. I don't know if I would put it in the same class as "" Rear Window"" though. It is just another type of story- I think that's why I gave it the 4 stars. The lack of the final star is a common complaint I have of these types of novels. They introduce all at once a part of the plot you could not see at all- nor imagine. It is not a bunch of chess pieces scrambled on a board that slowly rearrange themselves to reveal a final end. Instead these types of stories create critical clues out of the blue that fill in vital pieces of a picture never possible before the clues are revealed. I'd rather have all the pieces laid out there and when the fog lifts, you find yourself saying"" I should have seen it! Great job"". Nevertheless,  it was still a good story, filled with the sick helpless feelings being lost and depressed if things in a ""perfect world"" we're to suddenly go bad. You might want to go outside after finishing this book and look out at a clear sunny day and praise the good fortune of being healthy, happy  and trusting enough to believe all people have good in them. With this book Ms. Hawkin's cuts through this ""good"" as fantasy and paints a different picture of what we are or can be. Somehow, the will to survive and rising above it all- hoping we are still decent at our core may endure. But, you will have to read it to see if that is true.",4,10,2,4,10,8,7,11,10,23
"250",2.35,"I enjoyed this book and was even a tiny bit paranoid for a couple of days after. When I finished I thought I should have been disappointed, but I wasn't. ""Should've been"" because the main characters were not really very likable, bits of imagery from the story seemed implausible, and the writing style - three women telling the story all in the first person can be confusing especially if you put it down midway through one of them. ""Wasn't"" disappointed because an alcoholic trying to piece together information from her blackouts to solve a mystery was intriguing from the start, even if it's been done before, and I was fascinated to be allowed into the mind of this character I didn't much care for in the same way reading about a different place can transport you out of your normal everyday experiences, even when it's not just where you want to be. I imagine Hitchcock would have liked the ending as he used a similar theme in one of his stories ... I won't say which.",1,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,3
"251",1.7,"Almost everyone I know has read this book. I wish they had warned me that the first half of the book was five or six characters in search of a plot-line. The girl on the train was an emotional trainwreck, whinging on and on about her past while she drank herself into blackouts. The other characters that were presented were similarly self-absorbed. At about the halfway point there was some development of a storyline and it quickly became obvious who the bad guy had to be. The final quarter of the book quickly laid out the storyline, solved the riddle and revealed the culprit -- no surprise.If you liked ""Gone Girl"" this is similar, but not comparable. The characters are so nebulous and self-absorbed that it was impossible to care what happened to them. The plot wandered a lot which could have been interesting, but somehow it was not. I gave it two stars because it was well-written.",1,1,1,3,1,2,3,1,4,4
"252",0.75,"I agree with others who found the characters all so interchangeable and vile, their dialogue one lie after the other. The author's use of 3 first person monologues ever mixing was so annoying, though I get why she did it. It got so I couldn't tell who was doing the talking half the time, that's what I mean by ""interchangeable."" They were all awful, awful people. I got so frustrated with this that I rushed to finish it so I could be ""rid"" of it for good. Not one redeeming factor in any of these characters, all utterly without morals or apparently, will power... they deserved the misery this book was. I will skip Ms. Hawkins' next work and I don't intend to go see the film just released of this. My curiosity has been fed. But I had to see for myself if this was worthy of all the hoopla being made over it. Not in my world. Another ""Gone Girl""? Not even close.",6,4,4,2,3,3,3,5,6,7

I can usually guess the ending of movies and books pretty quickly but this one took me for a spin! It was exhilarating! I typically don't like when authors go back and forth between characters. If I can't read it in one setting going back and forth gets confusing. Because of how faced paced and exciting this book is I didn't have that problem. I was able to stay interested from the first page until the last. I was able to keep up with each character and loved how each one developed as you go through it. I felt like I was right there with Rachel through all her flashbacks. Definitely a best seller! Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer! Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out.

I am not saying this is a lovely story.  It is not.  It is ugly and scary, but it is written so beautifully that I enjoyed every word.  I was so enthralled with the writing that it took me awhile to realize that it is narrated by several people.  It was a smack myself in my doofuss head moment, but it didn't bother me at all to start the book again paying attention to who was speaking.Even if you do figure out who the bad person is early it doesn't matter because it's the story and how it unfolds that is important.

"258",2,"It takes a while for the reader to get passed the fact that none of the narrators in Paula Hawkins, ""The Girl on the Train"" are likeable reliable narrators.  All three of them have problems, their commonality a residential street of houses that backs the train going in and out of London each day.  As all three narrators get their turn to tell their story, the reader pieces together that they are connected in even more intricate ways.  Hawkins does a superb job of keeping the suspense up without revealing much of her hand until the very end of her tale.A young wife goes missing; one of the first person narrators, Rachel, knows the missing girl--she's observed her in passing from the window of her commuter train.  She wants to help the police; she wants to help herself.  She needs a new starting point in life because her husband has left her for another woman . . . and now they have an infant daughter.Hawkins writes of disturbed people whose faces are raw with shame and self-pity.  Her mystery revolves around need.  I listened to the unabridged audio presentation of this book; the performance gets high marks for theatricality and poignancy.  The narrators all have their flaws--there are no super human stereotypes here; together their voices pull together to find a light at the end of a dark tunnel at their own expense.Bottom line?  Some might find the characters too disagreeable to give them time to work their simple magic.  Make the time; this thriller is quietly exciting and chilling in its every day reality.

The author is really talented, but she goes down a very predictable path, and to me, both drops a bomb and advertises it's imminent arrival.  I wish she hadn't gone for the birthday party surprise (when you could clearly see your friends' cars parked in your neighborhood) and just taken it to another conclusion less like ""the butler did it gotcha!"" kind of thing.",1,5,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,5

The switching back and forth between characters was really confusing to me and I couldn't tell what was what. Then after my husband read it, he explained that once you get to a certain point it makes more sense and at least the characters are made clear. It did become more suspenseful and then I just needed to know who did it. My thoughts wavered a few times between the characters, but in the end it was not my first pick. It all made sense then and I'm glad it turned out the way it did. I'm glad Rachel and Anna helped each other in the end. Still a pretty creepy story though.

"265",1.85,"The Girl on the Train occupies a similar space as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. In both, we move through the minds of multiple narrators who may or may not be lying, to us and/or to themselves. This ends up being very effective and is what pulls you forward into the story, despite the fact that the inciting incident doesn't rear its head for thirty or forty pages.While there are three characters we focus on throughout the book, the first is arguably the main character: Rachel. She has been divorced for two years and is a serious alcoholic. She blames her drinking for her current state and for the end of her marriage. She's living with a friend, paying rent, and lost her job several months ago. Too ashamed to admit it to anyone, she continues to take the train into the city every day.The train stops regularly in the same place, behind some houses in a nice little town. From her vantage point on the train, Rachel watches a married couple go about their morning. She calls them Jess and Jason, though she doesn't have any idea what their real names are. She's constructed a perfect little life for them in her head.But it falls apart the morning Rachel sees Jess kissing another man on her back porch. And shortly after that, Jess goes missing entirely.I won't say more for fear of spoiling what is genuinely a good story. Just know that we get multiple perspectives on the events, and everyone is much more connected than may first be apparent. Highly recommended if you're into Gone Girl and that sort of dark, psychological thriller. A well-constructed mystery with compelling characters.",2,6,2,2,4,4,3,8,8,11

One day she sees SOMETHING, and nothing is ever the same.To be honest, this book was a bit of a letdown. All the hype. All the intrigue. It just fell a little bit flat, and left me feeling deflated at the end. I thought there would be MORE.This story is told in alternating perspectives from three different women: Rachel, Anna, and Megan, each with their own set of unique baggage. I disliked them all so much, I can’t decide who I like the least – but this was an I-enjoy-not-liking-you dislike, if that makes sense. However, none of them really roused much empathy from me, and I only developed surface level feelings. Frankly, I just didn’t really care all that much about any them.Don’t get me wrong, it was good enough, and certainly held my interest. I read it pretty quickly, and definitely was invested in the story. The alternating perspectives, and the way it jumped around in time, though commonplace in books these days, was, for the most part, successful here. The writing was simple, and clipped along at a decent pace to grab and maintain my attention.All in all, I would say read it, but it’s a case of been-there-done-that for me. It obviously works for some people though, given it’s reigning status at the top of the bestsellers list. I also think it would make a great book club pick, as it’s short, quick, and full of plenty of chat-able fodder.For more, visit www.bookishtendencies.com",5,11,3,4,7,5,4,11,9,20

Once you figure out the mystery you will watch the characters as they put together the pieces and make decisions leading to their ultimate destinies... and you will be unable to turn away, watching, wishing.As you read, you meet each character through both her own eyes as well as through the eyes of others... very intriguing.

There are two more women added as primary characters and here's the thing I've never experienced before, Ms Hawkins continues the story as each of these three women, seamlessly, speaking as each of them in the first person singular.  Just pay attention to dates and times of trains.  That's all I'm going to say.There are many, many reviews that you can read here that will tell you the whole plot.  I would never begin reading a book knowing the plot and I won't do that to you here.  What I will do is comment to people who have come to trust my taste as to whether they will enjoy this book.  Is it worth the money?  Is it worth your time?  To both I will say very big YES's !!!Paula Hawkins can write and reading her is such a pleasure after reading some of the junk that has been put out to us from really major writers.  You will enjoy the way she treats the English language and you will enjoy this very unusual story as it is narrated by three different women from their own points of view.Buy it.  Have a good read.",2,5,0,0,4,0,2,6,2,13
"311",5.25,"I have to be honest even with all the amazing reviews I still think I barely liked it.  I bought it because of the zillion good reviews and I am sure that is why most are buying it.SPOILER:I am ok at predicting plot twists but I feel like this one was very very obvious. I mean from the second they tell you Megan babysat and he smiled at her and then a few pages later ""he"" smiled at her driving by it was very obvious that it was Tom...I mean you can't help but compare it to Gone Girl and although I did not like the ending of Gone Girl , Gone Girl blows this book out of the water. Flynn's book is so smart and clever this is kind of boring and mostly about an alcoholic who you don't feel for and I could not even get myself to like a single character or be interested in any of them.I did not care for it at all to each his/her own.",1,1,2,1,3,3,1,4,2,6
"312",3.05,"Really, more of a 2.5 star review. The initial premise of a troubled woman who becomes engrossed in the ""passing lives"" of a couple whose home she sees daily from her train commute is a good one. Unfortunately, it was the highpoint of the book for me. I'd guessed the plot by about page 60, and really kept reading to see if I was correct. (I was) I truly kept hoping I would be surprised. The story is told from the point of view of three women: Rachel, Megan and Anna, with Rachel being the main character. She's a drunk. Eventually, she becomes an such erratic unlikable, needy repetitive drunk, I was just kind of hoping she'd jump from the train. The plot is facilitated by convenient blackouts, which I could buy into, but it's the clipped points of view of the other two characters that I found to be weak writing. The chapters from Megan and Anna's POV are limited because they're clearly holding back information they know--particularly Megan. A red flag example is a short Megan chapter dedicated to inner thoughts about her lover, whom she refers to as ""he."" The lack of a proper noun tells me the ""he"" she's having an affair with in this chapter is a different ""he"" than was mentioned by name in an earlier chapter. With only so many characters in the book, ""he"" became quite obvious. If you don't think too hard while reading, I can see where The Girl on the Train is an interesting book. I don't think the plot is anything close to masterful.",1,4,0,0,6,1,3,6,4,14
"315",3.4,"This is a tough book to review, because I cannot honestly say that I disliked it. I liked it. Begrudgingly, I liked it. It was a quick and easy read. I switched back and forth between the Kindle and Audible versions and though I liked the acting in the audiobook, I found myself just wanting to read because I could do so quicker than listening.This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl--seemingly complex characters that somehow seem completely base when you get to know them. There is no one to like or root for, which is frustrating, and you are not sure who to trust because there are multiple narrators. Everything leads up to a reveal, which I believe most readers will be able to figure out about halfway through the book, and then the story just ends.Unlike Gone Girl, I believe it was mildly well-written, capturing voice especially well. I also did not feel as if my time was wasted because it was such a fast read, and I did find myself thinking about the stories when I wasn't reading. I gave it three stars because emotionally, I let myself get involved, and any less stars would have been dishonest (but oh how I longed to give it only two!).This is a good beach or vacation read, something to excite you during the mundane winter months or pass the time on a long trip. It is not a life-changing journey, nor is it something that will leave you feeling as if you learned something, but it will certainly keep you guessing.",5,7,3,3,7,6,5,5,8,8

I haven't put it down in the last three days and it took me three days only because of work obligations. There are so many reasons why I loved this book. First, technically it is superb! Second, the transition of Rachel is exactly how it should of been stronger, but still flawed.

"319",2.65,"I know that I'm one out of thousands who wrote a review for this book but I just couldn't help myself in relating my viewpoint.  I bought the book from amazon because every article raved about the book, calling it the new ""Gone Girl"", which I also read.  The story revolves around three women; the girl on the train, Rachel, who really should be the ""woman"" on the train because she is no longer a girl, being in her thirties.  Meagan and Anna are the other two women in the story.  Rachel, who is out of work and an alcoholic, gets on the train every day to go to a job that she no longer has and returns at the end of the day to where she shares a flat with another woman.  She is also an ex-wife of a man who has remained in their home, with his new wife, the one who caused the divorce, and their baby.  The new wife is Anna and Meagan is their neighbor.  These people all live in homes bordering the train tracks and so Rachel, on her travels to her non-job, passes by and watches them in their daily lives, still pining away for her ex-husband and builds an imaginary life for Meagan who lives with her husband a few doors down.  As each woman speaks in the novel, you get an insight into what really is going on in her life.  The problem with the story is that Rachel, Anna, and Meagan all appear to have the same personality which confused me and I found myself going back several pages to see which woman was talking.  Since they each had different problems and lives it would make sense that they had varied personalities and would not sound like Rachel.  And even though Rachel didn't want her flat-mate to find out that she lost her job, I couldn't relate to the fact that she was spending every day traveling into London and back again, just to spy on her ex-husband, etc.  Many times I wanted to put the book down and forget it but once I pay for something, I force myself to read on, hoping it will improve, thus the ending, which I found a little more to my liking.  I can't say that this is the ""new"" ""Gone Girl"", because the story is different and I couldn't really get hold of the characters as well as I should.  It's the kind of novel that you take to the beach if you're near one, or read in the backyard for an afternoon.  For a first published novel, I think the author tried to put the story into perspective as she saw it, but I felt I had to push myself to finish the book.  Happily I did so that I could enjoy the ending.",2,5,1,3,9,3,1,11,5,14
"320",6.5,"I was so excited for this book, and I am so genuinely disappointed. There was nothing original or ""thriller"" about it plot-wise, the main character is highly unlikeable (there are no redeeming or even EXCITING or INTERESTING qualities about ANY of the characters, but the main one is just an unlikeable, bland, boring person), and the whole book is really very boring until the last 15 or so pages, and the action that fills those pages is VERY predictable. There's no plot twist, there's no hero or heroine, there's little to no character arc/development. The only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping for that spark or twist or something that people kept raving about. I would give it 1 star, but I feel that it does have potential to be a good movie if done correctly; I'll be seeing it.",2,6,1,1,6,1,5,5,4,11

I think it might take away from some of the elements of the writing that I personally might not have enjoyed otherwise if I had done so. (That said, I mention the main character in the next sentence but it's vague enough to not give anything away.) The main quality I found endearing about this book is the main character, Rachel. She's a hot mess in a dark place and I've definitely had times in my life that felt somewhat similar to that, so it was interesting to see how she handled some very less than comfortable situations. One of the main twists I actually kind of expected so I think that made the book seem a little bit less suspenseful to me, which made this would have been 4 star a 3 star for me.",2,3,2,1,3,2,0,4,3,6

"336",1.4,"A rare treasure, written with verve and suspense, impossible to put down, and yet it needs perspective, standing back from it, contemplating the nuances, the self-absorption, the narcisistic nature of alcoholism.  Narcisists don't have to be beautiful, they don't necessarily revel in their self-esteem.  Quite the contrary, underneath it all they fear they are not beautiful and their self-esteem is absent or damaged, but they are absorbed in their own reflection, content, in fact surreptitiously delighted to subject those around them to their compulsions.  Yet Hawkins has turned it all into a mystery thriller.  Her recourse for the character's catharsis is chilling.  Are all women masochists?  And do they love the sociopath in compelling men?  This book is exceptional, far more than just a ""good read"", despite the occasional and very minor slips in syntax.",2,5,1,3,8,4,5,5,6,12
"337",7.05,"I enjoyed the first three quarters of this book. It was exciting and fast-paced, and I enjoyed being pulled into the main protagonist’s mess of a mind. While she was a wreck and an alcoholic, I still found her sympathetic enough to be likable. One of the themes of the book was that no person or family is perfect, and I think the author did a good job of conveying this. I also enjoyed the buildup as we discover what’s going on with the other woman, Megan, in this story.My disappointment came toward the end. Maybe I’ve read too much fiction, but I didn’t find the twist all that exciting or interesting. Because of this, I did enjoy “Gone Girl” and the awesome use of the unreliable narrator a lot more. Given all the positive reviews, it seemed like “Girl on the Train” was going to lead up to something really unique. Given the deteriorating mental state of the protagonist, I was preparing myself for something along the lines of multiple personality disorder or finding out a character wasn’t real. (Not that those devices are completely unique—but I was still waiting for something kind of off the wall) Instead, it just becomes a terrifying domestic dispute. The men in this story are also very unlikable and needed a few more redeeming qualities.I’d recommend it for a fun summer poolside read but don’t expect too much.",2,6,3,4,8,3,5,12,6,19

There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.”Rachel Watson rides the train to and from London every weekday.

While waiting at the signal, she looks into her favorite track-side house, hoping to see the man and woman who live there. Although Rachel doesn't know them, she calls them Jess and Jason. Rachel has woven a fantasy about them, and they have the perfect life. Except they don’t.Desperately unhappy, Rachel has developed a drinking problem. She is unable to accept that Tom has remarried and lives with his new wife and their baby in the house he shared with Rachel. Rachel has made a nuisance of herself to the point of harassment--calling Tom repeatedly and stopping by to see him, especially after she’s been drinking.What Rachel sees from the train one day will compel her to insert herself into Jess and Jason’s lives and put her own in danger.This story was quick-paced and hard to put down. Although I cringed at some of the things Rachel did, her character was so well-developed, I could sympathize with her. The Girl on the Train is an excellent debut novel, and I can’t wait for more from this author.

"342",2.55,"3.5 stars actually. I was a fan of Gone Girl and this book is structured similarly. The first half was really suspenseful but, just like with Gone Girl, I figured out about half way through who the real villain was. That takes some of the suspense and enjoyment out of the reading. Another issue I had  is that the entire narrative depends on the main character's frequent and complete alcoholic blackouts. Now granted I don't know much about alcoholic blackouts but they seemed a bit too convenient in terms of the narrative. In fact, without them, the entire plot wouldn't exist. So, in summary, if you liked Gone Girl you'll probably like this one just don't expect to be too surprised when the killer is revealed.",0,2,0,2,0,0,3,3,1,6

Sure, the story offers some twists and turns, but it was just too slow. My life is not changed after reading it, as I like for it to be after reading a great book. Other reviewers say it is similar to ""Gone Girl,"" and was recommended to me after I read ""The Kind Worth Killing,"" both books in which I gave 5 star ratings to.

When Rachel was married to Tom she was not able to bear children and eventually she became more fond of the bottle than anything else. This quite often led her to have trouble recognising what was real and what was a dream. The story is narrated by the 3 women and explains to you what was going on with their lives.

In contrast to the tremendous, fantasy, 3rd person writing of Joe Hill, ""The Girl on The Train"", is rather straight foreword.This doesn't make ""The Girl on the Train"" bad, I love the book! Read it, it's a really quick read and it puts its reader in the shoes of multiple characters with a clever-ease that isn't confusing like I've found some other novels to be. But...if you're picking this book up after reading possibly one of the best books of your life, prepare to plateau in dissapointment.In vulgar terms, it's like if you dated a guy with a ten incher and you both break up, then get with a guy who's like 7 and a half inches.

When writing this review, I was trying to find something that I didn't like about it,to be fair, but couldn’t find anything and this is what my 5 star rating shows.The plot basically revolves around Rachel, who takes the same commuter train every day and suddenly sees something rather than usual, that changes her life for ever. This particularly event and a few mental-life crisis moments will make Rachel figure out that what is in front of you, sometimes is not always what it seems to be.It is told through the voice of three different women, which gives the narrative a more clear insight and adds mystery to the story.I have read Gone Girl before and I can say is one of my favorite thrillers of all time.I thought I was hardly ever gonna have the opportunity to read something similar to it, but let me tell you, I did and it was thanks to Paula Hawkins.There were sometimes that I couldn't believe what I was reading, it has an original  storyline that keeps your hearth pounding, gripping and wanting for more. I totally recommend it.Favorite Quotes:- “Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.”-“I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.”- “It's  possible to miss what you’ve never had, to mourn for it.”-“The holes in your life are permanent.

It was nearing the end before I figured everything out, and although there were some reveals I had not seen coming, nothing was out of sync with the portrayal of the characters. It was all one of those ""oh, that makes sense now"". With the back-and-forth chapters between characters and time, I would have done better with a hard copy of the book as opposed to the Kindle version as I couldn't remember the dates/times well enough without needing to look back (which is too much of a pain on Kindle for me to mess with). However, once each chapter started, it was pretty easy to keep up with whether the timeline was past or present so it wasn't a problem and made the story more intriguing than if were told straightforward. There were moments of suspense, but for me it was more thoughtful as I tried to work through what each character had been through, what they were feeling, the struggle with their past and their present, and how it affected their actions along the way as the book built up to ""what really happened"".

Told from three different women's points of view, The Girl On The Train is a suspense thriller at it's finest.I am a character driven reader and writer and the characters in this book are written brilliantly. Rachel is a literal train wreck herself but the author wrote her in such a way that I felt sorry enough for her to want to know her story. And I really wanted things to work out for her. The other characters were so full of mystery and intrigue I felt unease about each one, never truly knowing them or what they would do next.And I loved how the book ended.

That's about as much as I got from the blurb, and as I didn't read any other reviews, it took me awhile to figure out how this could even be interesting. However, there is much more to this story. The author fills in the plot holes slowly, and through different perspectives, but it all comes together.

This one had me guessing for quite some time, and the ending was believable-- accomplishing both of those tasks is rare.Cons:- The writing style. The story is told in first person from 3 different characters, but the style never changed from character to character. They felt one-dimensional and the change in perspective seemed more like a device to tell the story than anything else.- I didn't like any of the characters. This doesn't bother some people, but I like having someone to root for.- While the ending was believable, it felt rushed. Once you figure out what happened, you get about 10-15 pages of resolution.I'd recommend this book as a fun, (relatively) cheap read.

Rachel gives a lot of misinformation thru out the book aka blackouts dreams ect. related to her being an alcoholic which adds a Hitchcock feel to this story. it is a mystery novel . the book is slow in the beginning till you get to know who megan and anna  are, but hold on the book takes off like a running train lots of twists in this.

For e.g. it would have been great to know more about the killer - not the motivation, which was clearly laid out, but just more about the killer's tastes, personality, etc.The multiple narrator touch seems to be a new thing in literature, especially the unreliable-female-narrator.

It has almost no action (until the end) and is mostly a lot of sad people talking about their sad lives, but the way the author broke up this murder mystery made it interesting. Kind of how I feel about the romance in the movie “500 Days of Summer” where the story is pretty simple but the reveal is the fascinating part.

At that point, the narrative becomes strained and intentionally drawn out.  Finally, it is a well-known device of poorly written mysteries for the killer to ""tell all"" near the end of the novel.

Jumping between dates, Megan, Rachel, and Anna, I often find myself flipping back pages to see if what I was reading happened before or after doomsday.  Then when I got about 75% done, the bad guy became blatantly obvious.  No real physiological twist there.  I guess this is a good book.  It spent too many weeks on the NYT bestseller list to not be, right?  And it's already been optioned for a movie.  Have readers in general just gotten easier to please?",2,2,2,2,2,2,2,5,3,7
"494",2,"This thriller sucked me in. I loved how slowly the author unraveled the layers for the reader but still left enough questions to keep the reader doubting and questioning their own conclusions. I also applaud her strong multifaceted characterizations of all the female characters. They are all flawed but also real and they lack any shallow pretense. There is a melancholy intensity to all of them without being trite amd I appreciated them and the writing and story more for it.Writing from different character perspectives is difficult to achieve successfully but Hawkins does a great job of it.Highly recommend this book if you enjoy the combination of sharp, smart writing and thrillers.",0,1,0,1,2,1,0,5,4,8
"495",0.55,"This book really had me captured and sucked into the story. I would have read it straight through if I could have. The writer had me constantly trying to figure out who the ""bad guy"" was. I think that the writing was superb and the book kept me guessing.I highly recommend reading this book. It was full of suspense, drama, and a lot of twists and turns. Worth the money that I spent. The only downside is that the author gives your first person narrative of 3 women in the book and from time to time I had to keep flipping back to the beginning of the chapter because I'd forget the time line and who was narrating. The book has a lot of flash backs so it can get confusing at times. But over all I highly recommend this book!",2,3,1,2,1,1,2,4,3,8

Having said that, I didn't get what all of the hype is about with this book. It wasn't that powerful. The story itself was a great concept and told in 1st, 2nd and 3rd person. Rachel is a strong character and so is Megan and Anna.Rachel though, seems depressed and I think she's a little jealous of her ex's new situation. His new wife, a brand new baby. They moved into Rachel and Tom's old house and then he posts pictures on FB about how happy they are. Sad, but he isn't wrong for doing it. Everyone does it and though he and her didn't work out it isn't his fault that she is jealous or depressed.I had no idea beforehand how the end would come about and certainly don't want to spoil it here but it wasn't as strong in the suspense aspect as other rival novels in its genre and I couldn't wait to be done with it. I think this book tries really hard but it just can't get it done. It's not Gone Girl and it never will be.

In fact, I don't like ANYONE in this book!Does the writer make attempts at creating sympathy for some of these characters? Yeah...sort of. But there is a general disgust for everyone that is hard to shake off. I must admit, in the first couple chapters there is a fascinating draw to the narrative that did keep me reading...and reading...making me nauseous sometimes, sick and disgusted by stupid choices of our narrator, and then I became bored in the middle.I wanted to finish it, but I was sick of reading it. I put it down (metaphorically, since it's a Kindle) read something else and came back to finish it.And the finish was good. SCARY GOOD and mostly satisfying. No spoilers, sweetie! Just if you are looking for a book where you root for character and want to CARE for a main character, well....this ain't your book, baby.

Half the time I was frustrated with her and the other half I wondered how and when she would regain her memory of that night when Megan disappeared and the part she might have played.  One of the most important elements of the plot is time. I would recommend that readers remember the key date, July 13, to keep from getting lost because Hawkins skillfully moves the plot in concentric circles around that date.  This is a page-turner.

The characters are believable because they're ordinary, and they're easily forgotten because they don't say or do anything remarkable, clever, or challenging.  The device of the train is not exactly new, but a good writer with a feel for mystery and compelling characters could run with its possibilities.  The protagonist, Rachel, is an alcoholic filled with self-pity.  She is currenly exhausting the patience of her last codependent friend.  Oh, it's no use trying to review a book this shallow.

I don't read a lot of thrillers, but want to read more after this one.  Don't compare this to Gone Girl - it's way better, and way difference.  I really wanted to binge read this one, I wish I could have.  The characters were richly drawn, although sad in some cases, and the story was engrossing.  The story revolves around a woman not remembering critical (and potentially dangerous) events because she was black-out drunk, which was really unique and interesting - you got the sense of frustration on the main character's part to try and put the pieces of the puzzle together.  Loved it.....highly recommended.",1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,4,5
"505",2.4,"First and foremost, the writing in this book is bad. By the end of the first page, I knew it wouldn't even come close to living up to the hype and Gone Girl comparisons. The writing does not grab you or keep your attention, so finishing the book felt more like a chose than something I was interested in doing.The characters and the plot are poorly developed. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Several of the plotlines end up being completely pointless (ie they had nothing to do with the final ""twist"" or the fate of the main character).. I guess they are supposed to increase suspense but in my opinion reading the book was similar to the experience of watching someone bake a delicious cake and then throwing it away. I kept reading even though I was bored because I anticipated a shocking twist and interesting resolution (probably in large part because of all the Gone Girl comparisons), but the story never picks up steam or becomes interesting.Ultimately, I would advise against reading this.. if you're like me, you'll probably read it anyway because of all the hype, but it's really not worth your time.",2,5,2,2,1,3,2,1,6,11
"506",1.3,"A disturbing feeling. That's how I describe reading the life of the girl on the train. Her interest in complete strangers, a young couple who live on the same street as her ex husband and his new wife, is voyeuristic and downright creepy. She goes so far as to name them and imagine their relationship. This beginning sets up a dysfunctional mix of two neighboring couples and the ever watchful girl on the train--the ex-wife who is alcoholic and rides the train every morning to pretend she is still working a job so her roommate won't kick her out. In between her binges she puzzles over missing segments of her life that she fidgets with until convinced she has the missing part to the murder of the neighbor wife. If you like a snoop into  the lives of unstable, violent, and bizarre behavior this is your novel. The talent of the author that intrigued me was withholding information and weaving snippets of supposed truth throughout. At least it made me read to the end. This is a read with no literary merit. And personally, I would rather not have had these people enter my life. I found it disturbing and unsettling.",4,3,3,5,3,3,6,9,8,14

Every day you ride the same train on the same route with the same people into the same huge city where you're another anonymous cog in the wheel. Your sense of being invisible has become literal; you no longer care what passengers think of you as you open the gins and tonic (they're sold in cans in England) that will make the day go by in a pleasant fog. As far as you're concerned, you're a nobody. And each time the train passes your ex-husband's house, which used to be yours, you know that you're nobody. You see the new wife, the one he was seeing before he left you. And you notice that the daughter they had is getting bigger.So, you've trained yourself to look a few houses down. There's a woman sitting in her front garden. Some mornings she's reading; other times she's drinking a cup of tea. The man who comes out and joins her is not bad looking, and so, with nothing else to do you start to make up stories about the lives of the couple.

I ended up taking notes to avoid significant confusion.  I took notes up to about 41%.  By then everything was pretty easy to follow, but the dates continued to be critically important.  Once I got to 49% I was deeply involved and it was intense and enjoyable and I finished in about 24 hours, during which I did other things as well.  It was somewhat like Gone Girl although I ended up liking this and I totally hated Gone Girl because I didn't care if either character lived or died, in fact I wish she had died at the end.

"509",5.2,"I have mixed feelings about this novel. Like Gone Girl, it is a dark, surprising tale, and like Gone Girl, this novel features unreliable narration. Beyond that, I'm not so sure why there are so many comparisons between the two novels. I enjoyed the multiple points of view, and I appreciated that the characters were drawn with such unapologetic realism and complexity. That being said, there wasn't one likeable character in the entire novel, and while reading it, I desperately wished for just one positive nuance in any one of the characters. I also found that because this book was told out of chronological order, the various dates became difficult to keep up with. I was utterly delighted by the ending. I never once guessed what was actually going to happen, and in a novel of this level of dark suspense, that is a tremendous achievement. If you enjoy unreliable narration or a good, dark psychological thriller like Gone Girl or Mudvein, then I definitely think this book is worth the read. I will be very interested to see what Ms. Hawkins writes next.",0,6,1,2,5,2,4,6,2,10

In the beginning, it looked like a mystery built exclusively around the weakness of two of the main characters (one alcoholic with blackouts, one manic pixie dream girl wannabe unreliable narrator), but the slow burn ending and the perspective of the very sensible, cold and practical third protagonist brings on the reread element, just for kicks and foreshadowing.Only four stars because all of the characters (except Cathy, who is a cinnamon roll too good for this world) rely heavily on the reproduction / maternity angle for background issues and motivation, and I personally find it a bit of a cliché.

I heard that it will be turned into a motion picture, which makes me question, how many of the scenes will be of a disheveled alcoholic sitting on a train (doesn't sound too exciting of a movie)?The book was a quick read, I finished it over the course of weekend. You won't walk away with a profound understanding of alcoholics or anything of that nature.

As more and more information came to light, the plot just became more and more enticing. It is a little easy to see the ending coming from about halfway through, but there are enough other things going on that it doesn't take away from the read.

It would have been helpful to have a little notebook handy and write down which character and date I was reading as the chapters jump back and forth a bit just as they did in Gone Girl and initially I found it difficult to follow but it is well worth persevering. Rachel, the main character is fascinating to follow as she embeds herself in the lives of others and tackles her own issues at the same time. I started to determine the answers to the mystery about halfway through and was pretty sure about it at about the three quarter mark. I would have liked the story to have given a bit more detail around the character of Megan as it would have been nice to see what made her tick also. Overall, a great and entertaining story.

If you add the fact that I tend to be a contrarian reader, i.e. I tend NOT to read what everyone raves about, I was incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed this little masterpiece.Story is all told in the first person by the three main female characters, which keeps the pace fast enough to keep you turning pages but also gives you pause to think and absorb. You will probably figure out the culprit as you start delving into the thick of the book, but it doesn't really matter: Anna, Rachel and Megan will make you grimace, smile, cringe and always find a way to reach inside of you. That's the most stunning feature of this book: I read many novels that made me connect with THE main character, but I have seldom found myself in the shoes of all the key characters.My final piece of advice: pick it up before you go on vacation, or off for long relaxing weekend, maybe if you have long train commutes (ahem) ahead of you.

There are three voices, and they all sound exactly the same.  But for Ms. Hawkins telling you what character is narrating, you'd never know which woman is which.  The three narrators are given slightly unique traits: one's a drinker, the other has a baby and the last one is missing.  The audio book was superior because three women narrated so they had actual unique voices, which helped differentiate the otherwise similar characters.I wouldn't recommend the book, but if you need something to while away a short plane ride, it isn't terrible.",1,0,1,3,3,4,1,3,4,8

What weighed me down was that there was not one strong character that took the lead. I could not connect to whiney women, and men I knew little about. The good news is that if you're a woman, you'll identify with the ""I'm every woman"" concept that carries through the novel. Nothing is new under the sun here, except finding ""whodunnit.""

None of the characters were particularly lovable, just flawed in their own ways.  It was very suspenseful and moved the reader along well.  Except for being the tiniest bit drawn out, it was very hard to put down.  I didn't figure out the ending before the point at which they wanted me to know the ending, and that's always good.

I don’t need to jump into the action on page three. But it is just me.The main female characters are drawn beautifully. One is an obsessed wreck of a woman. Another is a manic, complicated and a very unhappy girl. Finally, the third woman is a mistress who becomes the second wife, and who gleefully gloats about it. What’s not to love about this assemble of women?The story is twisted. The plot is tight. The main narrator is unreliable because most of the time she is drunk and cannot remember anything.

In our every day lives the stories are not revealed, even when we play a part in them, we don't always  understand the story or our roles within it.

"567",2.5,"This is an engaging story of human frailties and trials. It is told in the first person, by different characters, which gives an extra layer of interest.

The most consistent complaint is that none of the three main women characters were likeable, in fact, pretty much unlikeable.  I agree.  But so what.  You always have to have some likeable character?  Life is not like that.  If you need always someone likeable, stick to books written for teens.  Some had trouble following the plot.  It is not tricky at all, in fact, Ms. Hawkins is pretty ingenious in the way she plots this book.  A lot of books move backwards and forwards in time for seemingly no reason other than to be literary; this book has excellent reasons and it works.  Finally some claimed they figured out the (SPOILER ALERT) killer before coming close to being finished.  Baloney.  This is well-written, well-plotted, different and well done.  Sure if you think back on it some of it seems preposterous, but, there are very few mysteries in which that does not happen.  Congratulations Mr. Hawkins.  Well done.

"569",5.9,"The storyline does a reasonable job of exploring the personalities of the characters, particularly the images in the imagination of ""The Girl On The Train"" in and of herself as she sees images from something of a distance, and frames illusions about what they mean. From my perspective this presents a tale of a person who really doesn't seem to know herself very well, replaces ""knowledge"" with suppositions, as well as other characters in the play, and as events unfold they grope through and eventually learn more about their foundations of themselves and among each other.Yes, there is some mystery that unfolds in a very slow way, and my guess is that we as readers actually know some people that have issues as told in the story that the characters will remind us of knowing. It is possible that some readers will ""see"" themselves in the tale.

Ultimately it comes together and the time line becomes less important.Altogether though, I think it was a well constructed story, interesting to follow. The most interesting character was struggling with alcoholism and I believe the portrayal by the author was very on target and fascinating to follow.Aspects of it make it not-such-an-easy read, but it certainly makes you think, and that's ok too.Generally well done - I would read another by this author.",1,3,1,1,0,1,0,2,1,6

Although I do think some kind of moral reflection makes for a stronger and more memorable protagonist. It’s okay to have the dregs of humanity populate your story, but in this one, they move through it like a bunch of snakes in a pit – not thinking beyond their most primal impulses.I give the writer credit for keeping me reading, having created a certain amount of tension and suspense.

Really exciting psychothriller type story, with multiple POVs... can't wait to see the feature film. Apparently actress Rebecca Ferguson of the awesome new Mission Impossible is going to star, alongside the very talented actress Emily Blunt. This book really isn't like Gone Girl, per se, except in the sense that someone is murdered and it is a thrilling fiction read... as this book is quite mysterious until near the end (with GG, you know pretty quick that the wife is a crazy-arse beeyatch who is framing her hubbers) as you don't really know who did the deed. Also, this story is a full-on ensemble piece. Omgosh, know that I'm gushing but this is a book to re-read and can't wait to see the film. Hope the author writes more thrillers, will definitely read.

I didn't like any of the characters enough to truly feel invested in them. Although I liked the 'just desserts' for one of the baddies in the end. That was satisfying.

As an alcoholic, the girl became a different person when she drank too much, became involved in the lives of the people she watched from the train and almost lost her life because of that.

I am not the best person to review mystery novels because I usually guess who did it before the big reveal. However, I thought the author did a pretty good job of making you doubt what you thought (although she did so by painting every male character as menacing). The main character, Rachel, is pretty sad.

If perhaps she would have pointed me in the direction of the killer, a little earlier, and showed the minds of the other suspects (that we all contemplated) just a little sooner, I for one would have been happier. There did come a point where both my wife and I - we read it aloud to one another - were like ""get on with it, we're ready for a climax here.""Believe it or not, there were a few grammatical mistakes (IMHO).

The marriage was falling apart even before as Rachel was not able to conceive. Rachel takes a train every day to London even though she has lost her job there. She watches her old house and a neighbor's from the train. She is able to observe what is going on the porches of these home. The couple in the neighboring house seem to be greatly in love until one day Megan the wife is found murdered. Murderer's identity remains secret almost until the end.",1,3,2,3,5,3,2,6,5,9
"725",7.7,"I found this to be a solid, enjoyable thriller. The story is told in the first person by the three female protagonists. One of the threads is deferred significantly in time. This structure works quite well to produce the suspense on which the success of this type of narrative depends. It perhaps falters a little however in its depiction of the male characters. We see then through the women’s eyes but really don’t get enough food for thought about them to enable us to make an educated guess about their role in the novel’s key event. It terms of style, it has its moments, not least the following keen observation about the British urban landscape:“a 1960s new town, spreading like a tumour over the heart of Buckinghamshire. No better or worse then a dozen other towns like it, a centre filled with cafes and mobile-phone shops and branches of JD Sports, surrounded by a band of suburbia and beyond the realm of the multiplex cinema and out-of-town Tesco”",0,5,0,3,3,2,2,5,2,9

It was a very decent read, but I can't help feel it could have been so much more with the premise and start of the story being as thought out as it was.  The story revolves around a divorcee who binge drinks and her inability to be a 'reliable' witness in a missing persons case. This could have gone many ways, but ended up with all the males in the story being  users of the women they were with in many different incarnations. This was more the crux of the story; rather than being a mystery (which it still was) it was also a statement on the abusive side of relationships. I would go 3 1/2 stars, but you can't do halves.

I was irritated because I have rarely walked away from even the most boring, tedious tale.I'm a reader, 60, educated and a male. This doesn't put me in the target audience. But I could have enjoyed the ride if it just moved along a little or if ALL the characters weren't petty, self absorbed basket cases.

The author makes you care so much for each character, regardless of their weaknesses. Will their strengths of character emerge to bring this complicated human puzzle to a satisfying end?

Didn't figure it out way in advance of the end but the possible murderers that the reader is supposed to suspect come across as so deliberately red herrings.  So it becomes a game of who's left after you eliminate the other possible suspects.  If this were not a book group selection I probably wouldn't have finished.

The story as it progresses is quite intriguing and keeps the reader hooked, but as it nears the end, the story becomes a tad predictable. The story is centered around Rachel, the protagonist who is made to believe that she doesn't remember anything after black out, but one day she ends up being a witness to a murder when she is totally drunk.

When the female part of the couple goes missing, the main character inserts herself into the investigation, sure she has information that is valuable. As the mystery deepens, she then wonders if she was somehow involved, as she had a 'blackout' episode at the time of the disappearance.

There were a few obvious red herrings but the suspense was maintained throughout. Also, I think the author nailed the behavior of an alcoholic as well as how such behavior has a ripple effect on everyone else.

I have ""divorced"" more than one book before reading even twenty pages - live is too short and there are too many truly good books to read.

"886",1.85,"<<possible spoiler-ish info, so use caution>>Paula Hawkins' debut novel hooks you pretty quickly.Rachel Watson takes the same train to and from her suburban London home every day. She has grown accustomed to the people on the train, and the things the train passes along its route, especially a set of houses set back from the tracks. Most days the train stops at a signal which allows her to observe the people in those houses, and she imagines they are living happier lives than she is. She often sees one attractive couple, whom she's named Jason and Jess, and she's invented careers for them, and feels so good about their relationship.One day, what she sees from her seat on the train shocks her. ""Jess"" is kissing another man! How could she jeopardize the perfect relationship that she and ""Jason"" have? Rachel is devastated and angry, since her own life is in a shambles, and she has idealized this couple she doesn't know. And when ""Jess,"" whose real name is Megan, disappears the next day, Rachel is shocked—and feels that she needs to tell the police what she saw. Little by little, she gets more involved in the investigation about what happened to Megan, because she wants to do her part, and she feels that she knows something.The thing is, though, Rachel isn't entirely reliable. She has a bit of a drinking problem—well, a big drinking problem. And sometimes she has trouble remembering what happens when she drinks. But she has this feeling she might have seen what happened to Megan. If only she could remember...""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""The Girl on the Train is the story of a woman who feels as if life has tossed her out, and she cannot regain her momentum. She is desperate to feel needed, to feel wanted, included again, so when she sees an opportunity to try and help out with the investigation into Megan's disappearance she jumps at the chance. But she doesn't count on her own lies and inadequacies being revealed, or being forced to confront her own issues.Hawkins is a terrific writer and has written a taut, compelling book, despite the fact that many of its characters are pretty unlikeable. The book is told from multiple perspectives—Rachel, Megan, and Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife. I found my mind spinning with all of the different possibilities of what happened, and what was going to happen. I came up with outlandish theories, theories that seemed they had merit, and one I hoped wouldn't be the case.Then sadly, in my mind, Hawkins punted. She took the easy way out, and it honestly killed the book for me. I don't think I'm smarter than many people, although I guess I read a lot of thrillers, but I totally saw the ending coming. I was truly disappointed.I'd definitely encourage you to read this book and formulate your own opinions. So many people have absolutely loved it in its entirety, and been shocked by the way everything transpires, so perhaps you will as well.

Train's premise is fun especially for those of us who enjoy peering in people's houses  and lives unobserved from the window of a train or car but  the execution is amateur. Still it is a compelling read.  Rachel is a fun character, a total loser who has kind of accepted her rejected, drunken status and doesn't seem to get to rattled about anything.

Maybe my expectations were, therefore, too high.  I found it hard to ""root for"" anyone; even the main character was hard to feel for, as her difficulties were for the most part self inflicted.  You have to pay attention reading this book.  The chapters switch among the three main characters, which was easy enough to follow.  But what I missed at first is that they are not necessarily in chronological order.  So when I got to a new chapter and saw which character's perspective was being told, I had to read the date and then go back to the previous chapter and compare dates to see if I was going backwards in time.  Easy enough to figure out, but just something to keep track of.

She is especially concerned with a couple that lives in a house in her old neighborhood. She believes their life to be perfect. But all that changes as the woman turns out to be missing and the story turns to reality. Now the author moves the story along as told by the three main characters viewing the same events from each characters point of view. It was very interesting and difficult to decide who had the correct view as each had their own previous experiences that colors their outlook and Rachel has a drinking problem with blackouts.

All three women base their happiness on whether or not they are desired by men. Scenes of confrontation that could be have been filled with dramatic tension, such as the ending scenes with Rachel and Anna, or Rachel and Tom, ended up contrived and ho-hum.

All of the characters are deeply flawed. The three main women - Rachel, Megan, Anna are compelling nonetheless. They make terrible mistakes and use incredibly poor judgement.

The chief problem is that all three of the female characters are similar, and the two male characters are nearly identical .  Furthermore, each character began to sound like the other.  It is the responsibility of the writer to have each of the characters speak differently--different rhythms, different word choices--all this helps the reader to differentiate who is who.

Although it took me a while to catch on to the chapter structure of the book, in the end it was a brilliant hook that kept the plot twists coming in fresh waves of deceit.Set in England, focusing on nos. 15 and 23 Blenheim Road along an active set of commuter railroad tracks; Rachel Watson has a daily fixation on the people she sees living out their lives along the tracks as she travels in to town for work. Until one day the daily routine of bliss and serenity goes dark. Rachel finds herself caught up in the swirling ebb and flow of deceit as she finds herself pulled into the middle of a missing persons investigation.I found the unique [to me anyway] chapter structure engaging, serving as a series of flashbacks and among the series of first person accounts that drive the story forward. I shudder to think just how real and probable this plot can be. The human mind and the heart that drives it is so very depraved that the evil depicted in this story is very believable.While I don't mind a bit of profane language in a story where it's a real world situational necessity - soldiers swear in combat, lovers loose their tongue when in the heat of discord, etc. - the language got a bit rough toward the end which was a bit of a turn off for me.

I have, in my former life taken many, many commuter type journeys mostly around the suburbs of London, and know just what the experience is like, especially the unpleasantness of the heat and overcrowding.That knowledge alone made it a very real experience for me, as there was a huge amount of time spent with this.  I hope that the words were good enough to make anyone who has not experience this ""feel it"" too.As for the story itself, I wasn't really wowed by it.

The ""multiple viewpoint first person"" narrative (I'm sure there's a more technical literary name for this) is an interesting conceit but a bit confusing at first. In my view, the  story could have been told just as effectively by only two of the 3 narrators. Also one thing that gets missed in this format is any broader descriptive detail and explicit point of view on the evolution of modern British suburban society that lends itself to the rise of twits like these people (since only one of the 3 female narrators --and none of their 2 dimensional male counterparts--will admit to being twits as part of their narrative)The story itself could actually take place anywhere; needn't have been the Home Counties in the UK. However, compared to the mindlessness of the post-yuppie suburban twits we have in the US, these UK versions are pretty soft-edged, maybe even tolerable neighbors. Maybe I'll emigrate.The intersection of the personal narrative of the ""main"" protagonist and the mystery she's drawn into means there are inevitable missed turns on the plot roadmap. At one point I was flipping back through earlier pages thinking I'd either missed something or had inherited the heroine's propensity for drunken blackouts. Had this been a movie we would've commented ""hmmm, guess the last half of THAT plot line ended up on the cutting room floor.""All that aside, this was a decent read and a good diversion. I look forward to reading her next effort. also look forward to what I assume will be the inevitable film version of ""girl on a train"", which I think could actually rectify some of the plotting and narrative blind spots of the book. ) This book is being marketed as ""the next Gone Girl"", but in the right hands, I think a film version of this book could be so much stronger than Gone girl, which I thought had all the predictability of ritual Kabuki theater but with a suspenseful soundtrack.",2,4,2,3,2,2,4,4,5,14

What makes me say this has a great deal to do with the hypnotic writing style of the author- there is something eerie but magnetic with it and it is a huge mystery to me how the author is able to put across layers of meanings in the simplest thoughts and the most mundane phrases the female characters who are also the narrators utter.It is also noteworthy how the author, in order to craft this forbidding tale, deftly chose these three women who are most flawed and most foolish and yet are unexplainably capable of receiving the reader’s empathy. Of the three POV’s, I was most glued to that of Rachel’s (the major character) whose loneliness seems to magnify her imagination which consequently becomes the core of the plot.It is also quite impressively baffling that the plot seems both linear and rounded at the same time.

It's not often you find an author that can write a character that you don't always like but still write a good book.

She drinks to dull her emotional pain, she rides the train into town without a sense or purpose, and now she finds herself meddling in other’s peoples affairs- literally. As a former resident of Blenheim Road, she’s always watching as she passes by...

For a debut novel, it was a brilliant depiction of the most basic elements of fallen human nature--envy, greed, lust, deceit, all tied in with murder, emotional and sexual hunger, and obsession on a grander scale.I am thankful to my new favorite author, Paula Hawkins, for:1) Not giving us a Gone Girl ending, especially with all the main characters' aversion to truth. This type of unpredictability suited Gone Girl because of the utter vileness of the ''heroine,""and we know that life never turns out the way we want, and sometimes evil triumphs over good. But I think letting Rachel live and killing off Tom finally gave the reader some breathing room to say, ""Finally. Something goes right."" (Or at least that's what I say, given that I felt like I was reading the book on a fast-paced train with my pulse beating fast and heartbeat ricocheting in my chest.)2)Giving me a character I can relate to. Only instead of alcohol, I'm addicted to caffeine. I felt that Rachel Watson was somewhat of an extension of me. We're both curious, (need to know), we're both driven by a sense of doing what's right (if you see something, say something), although I don't know if I would have had the nerve to do what she did, we've both said our share of ""I'm sorry"" to people we love (after acting similarly), and we're both fat. Instant buddies for sure. Throughout the novel, she makes stupid decisions (just like I do), but I found myself feeling protective of her. I did not want her to meet Megan's fate. So thanks to Ms. Hawkins for giving me a new best friend.3). Writing a book with a potential for changing lives. At the core of this novel is this undeniable theme: We are all only humans. We have our successes, our failures. Our strengths, our weaknesses. We are individually different but together all the same. All of us have hope of redemption. Rachel was an alcoholic until she realized the value of memory over apologizing for things she doesn't remember. Anna liked being the homewrecker until she found out the train wreck her life had become with Tom's infidelity and her ex-nanny's betrayal. For some, redemption was too late. Megan and Tom wanted something they could not obtain in their own lives so they reached out to each other for a temporary pleasure, which inevitably costs them their lives. Though the reality of my life is nowhere nearly that drastic, I can honestly say that I am somewhat changed by the lessons in this novel. It has touched my heart in ways that only truly great literature can.Though I'm sad at the end of this journey and that I have to debark, I hope other readers will get the chance to ride this fast-paced thriller on wheels, accompanied by suspense and page-turning anticipation running through their fingertips.",12,17,12,15,17,15,11,19,23,33

As I was approaching the end, I was completely invested in how the story would turn out and would have been miserably disappointed if it had not been well done.  I was not disappointed, this was an excellent read from beginning to end.

Thank goodness the last half slowly begins to build suspense, as I was just about ready to give up on this one.The story is told by the ex-wife, the current wife, and the victim, but NOT in chronological order, making it a little difficult to follow the plot line.

After I made the crucial connection, I dutifully finished the book, but it wasn't nearly as fun. Cheers to the writer for completing a book that has garnered a good deal of attention and praise, but I likely will not be recommending this as anything more than a summer beach book.

If this 1st person technique weren't being employed I would say this is really one character dumped into plot threads. In fact what drives this novel is plot reveals and manipulation of the reader. That's okay if it is wed to deepening characters where the nature of these people and caring about what happens to them is as relevant.

Then the neighbor, Jess/Megan goes missing. The story is told in chapters of alternating voices: Rachel, the ex-wife of Tom; Anna, who marries Tom next; and Megan, who lives two doors down, gores missing, and is not what she seems, either. In fact, nothing is as it first seems. What happens to Megan?  Who is responsible?  About three quarters of the way through, I had a pretty good idea.

I had no preconceived ideas about it and did not know the story line. Given the number of great reviews, I was pretty shocked when I was halfway through it and simply not engaged. I could have put it down and not returned to it. I get the theme of ""these-characters-aren't-who-you-think-they-are"", but how many chapters of the main character's obsessive screw ups, alcoholism, mental instability,  and self-loathing do we need to witness before thinking the author doubts our comprehension and needs to repeat it for us?For awhile, the most interesting part for me was the momentary supposition that Megan and Rachel were the same person due to MPD - at the same time knowing the impossibility of that considering the cross-over of people in both their lives. By the time the author fleshed out Meghan's background issues - I just didn't care. It had taken too long and I just didn't care to pick up the [new] baggage of Meghan's self-loathing after spending half the book watching Rachel embrace her pathetic-ness.I don't know if one would consider it a ""disclaimer"" but I have a degree in Criminology, so I may be more pragmatic in my attitude. I read a lot of mystery/thrillers and feel I am easily engaged and don't tend to over criticize.With that said, (and trying to avoid spoilers) - I thought the perpetrator was obvious early on, based on actions and history......not conversation and pretenses.

It was a good buy. It kept me entertained for the two hours or so that I read each night before I go to bed.The first person narrator is totally unreliable, which can frustrate some people, but I find fun. In that respect, it reminded me a lot of the book Gone Girl, only in this case, the missing woman is not the main female character, although we do get to see things from more than one character's perspective.I found myself wanting to find out what was going to happen next, as the narrator doesn't remember the events of a very important evening. This seems to be a plot device that works well. I just read E. Lockhart's We Were Liars, and her narrator had amnesia about a specific summer.Anyhow, The narrator is a wreck--a drunk who is obsessed with her ex-husband and a couple who live in an apartment she can see while on her train ride each day to a job she was fired from (See? She's a wreck!). This woman gets herself into some trouble. I don't want to say too much more about the book for fear of giving too much away, but I will say that this is a whodunnit.It kept me guessing the entire time I was reading. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. It seemed very Hollywood-ish to me, but as far as the twists and surprises go, it fulfilled them. The characterization was the main problem I had with the ending.The characterization in the rest of the book was strong. Paula Hawkins has a clear grasp of character and motivation. Each character who tells his or her story has a distinct and interesting voice.This is a fun, in a dark sort of way, book for people who like mysteries. Give it a chance!

As was true with Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train must be read carefully, and the reader must pay close attention to details, including the dates embedded in each chapter.The story is told by three women. Rachel, whose life has pretty much bottomed out, rides a train to London every day to fool her flatmate into thinking she has a job. She entertains herself by looking into houses along the tracks and becomes almost obsessed with a couple she sees daily. In Rachel's mind, they are the golden couple and the object of her envy. She even gives them names.Anna, whose house is close to that of the golden couple, is the wife of Rachel's ex-husband, Tom. They have a young daughter, Evie. The affair, which ended Rachel's marriage, was devastating to her, but the most hurtful thing was Anna's pregnancy. Rachel had desperately wanted a child, but the only round of IVF that she and Tom could afford failed and the marriage with it.Megan, the golden wife, lives with her husband, Scott, in another house along the railroad tracks. Rachel is so enthralled by the couple that she fabricates stories about what she considers to be their perfect life. This all charges when she sees Megan kissing another man from the train window.Rachel's already turbulent life takes another nosedive when Megan goes missing. Determined to help the police find her, Rachel is brought into contact with her detractors, Anna, Tom and Scott. Because of her alcoholism, she is treated as a pariah by them and as an unreliable witness by the police. Even she distrusts her faulty memory.The story has countless twists and turns, which demand the reader's complete attention. The characters are beautifully developed as the complex people they are. Just when I thought I had a handle on them, I discovered a new nugget, which completely changed them. As is true in all well-written books of this genre, no one is what he or she seems on the surface. The writing flows effortlessly, gradually building to a climax.I highly recommend The Girl on the Train to fans of books like Gone Girl.

Even though the house was filthy dirty and infested with mice, she seems to always be dreaming of her life back in Holkham. And now instead of running an art gallery, she is a babysitter for a baby a few doors down from their flat. But she hates that job. She wants something better. Someone better. Someone she can tell her secrets too. Maybe like the man who shows up whenever Scott isn't home? Someone other than her therapist?Anna is Tom's wife and mother to Evie. Tom was a married man that got her pregnant. He divorced his wife and married her. They moved into the house that Tom and his ex-wife lived in. All her friends told her that she was insane for moving into that house. His ex-wife will just not leave them alone. If it weren't for her, Anna's life would be perfect.

"1631",14.9,"I have to be honest, I’m conflicted in my thoughts/feelings about the book. It ended up not being what I had expected, but I couldn’t deny that I still kept on reading and that the whole book was put together very well.The story took a while to take off. The first couple of chapters came off as more of the beginning of a contemporary women’s fiction novel than a mystery/suspense book. Paula Hawkins really took the time to introduce us to the main players of her tale, which I appreciated having all the characters including the protagonist, Rachel, be a little on the dysfunctional side. It was refreshing to read characters with flaws/issues that can make them unlikeable but in a certain way very sympathetic and real. But as I was saying, the time spent on the character profiles (for lack of a better term) was so much that when that pivotal moment of the plot occurs, the combination of the lead up to it and the subtly of the moment, you would miss it if you didn’t know what to look for. I was expecting the moment to be bigger with more action (especially since the book basically bases its whole story off of it) and so I was a little underwhelmed when I realized what occurred. This exemplifies some of my feeling regarding the book. Perhaps my expectations were too high or I had a set idea of how the book was going to be, but it left me a little underwhelmed. It didn’t mean I didn’t enjoy, but I wanted to be more engrossed or enthralled like I have been with other mysteries/thriller/suspense (i.e. I Am Pilgrim, Night Film). One word I would use to describe the book is “quiet”. The story moved at a steady pace without any real action that left me reeling or a “what just happened?” moment that increased my need to continue with the reading. With this book I felt I had this detached interest and that I was reading because I wanted to know exactly what happened and how it will all end. Did I have that “edge of my seat”, “page-turner” feeling as I was reading? No. But it still manage to spark my interest and had good qualities that I can objectively appreciate.Upon finishing the book, I can value the way Hawkins structured the story and developed the plot and her characters. She did a good job of creating a cast that, as I have mentioned before, are far from perfect. They each have their dysfunctionality/issues that make them unlikeable. However, it’s nice to have these flawed individuals, specifically Rachel, try to make sense of a mystery when they themselves have trouble making sense of their own lives. It really plays into the issue of credibility and whether you can believe what you are reading from them which helps in the story’s plot. I actually loved Hawkins’ use of misdirection along with the multiple POVs. This is a good example where POVs are helpful in the story’s plot. It not only provided background and illustrated the inferences vs reality aspect (regarding Megan), but the information you got led you down multiple paths in what you believe was the truth and it wasn’t until the end where you realize you never truly knew what was going on. I have mentioned this before, when a book can surprise me with a twist or an unforeseen plot point, it really raises my regard for it.Would I put this book along with some of the other mystery/suspense book that I highly regard? Probably not. This book didn’t have that extra spark/energy that they did. This book is more on the subtle side that gave it a quiet and steady tone. Does that mean it wasn’t well-written and well put together? No. I can still recognize the good work it contains and praise the book and Hawkins for it. It was different from what I expected (this probably influenced some of my feelings) but that doesn’t mean the book was bad.",4,10,3,6,9,5,7,15,5,28

"1662",2.45,"It appears that I am in the minority, giving this novel 3 stars. Readers either love it or hate it. Which is fine, and is the  purpose of having reviews published. When you find reviewers who seem to like the same books you do, you're more inclined to consider other books they liked- that's all. No better, no worse, just different.So, on to the three star rating: This was a light summer read. I personally did not care for the author's style of writing nor how she presented the plot. There was too much focus, I thought, on how much and in what ways, Rachel got drunk, for example.  I got it. She's a raging alcoholic. No need to elaborate on each of the many incidents. And some of the events seemed just too unbelievable. As if someone could sneak into your home, drunk, take your baby while you sleep next to her, then run outside with her and not wind up in jail on attempted kidnapping charges!In addition, I wasn't crazy about the author's style of writing. If you haven't read the novel: each chapter is presented from the point of view of one of the 3 female characters, written in the first person. I began to notice that each started to sound like the others; same way of speaking, even the same expressions, at times. I found it difficult to differentiate among them, since they sounded the same. And since they are all deeply flawed, they needed more character development in order for the reader to find something redeemable about any of them. The reader needs something to hang on to- empathy, sympathy, relate ability- in order to care about a character. I didn't find this to be the case.Perhaps some of my disappointment here lies in the fact that I had just finished All The Light We Cannot See. Beautifully written and developed. Talk about caring for the characters... wow.I am not sorry that I read the book. It is a quick, somewhat entertaining read. Not something you have to dedicate part of your life to.

I did not expect the tone of the book to be what it was though. It was dark, somewhat twisted- no, I mean a lot twisted. The characters all had personal demons. Wading through the trough of the harsh lives, cheating and treachery of the characters, I tried to see a thread of where Ms. Hawkins was taking the story. Brushing the fumes of alcohol aside and the blackout laden plot, I started to have my own theories build. The theories waxed and waned. I solved the mystery 4 or 5 times before enough detail became evident to reason it out. It was a good effort on Hawkin's part. I don't know if I would put it in the same class as "" Rear Window"" though. It is just another type of story- I think that's why I gave it the 4 stars. The lack of the final star is a common complaint I have of these types of novels. They introduce all at once a part of the plot you could not see at all- nor imagine. It is not a bunch of chess pieces scrambled on a board that slowly rearrange themselves to reveal a final end. Instead these types of stories create critical clues out of the blue that fill in vital pieces of a picture never possible before the clues are revealed. I'd rather have all the pieces laid out there and when the fog lifts, you find yourself saying"" I should have seen it! Great job"". Nevertheless,  it was still a good story, filled with the sick helpless feelings being lost and depressed if things in a ""perfect world"" we're to suddenly go bad. You might want to go outside after finishing this book and look out at a clear sunny day and praise the good fortune of being healthy, happy  and trusting enough to believe all people have good in them. With this book Ms. Hawkin's cuts through this ""good"" as fantasy and paints a different picture of what we are or can be. Somehow, the will to survive and rising above it all- hoping we are still decent at our core may endure. But, you will have to read it to see if that is true.",4,10,2,4,10,8,7,11,10,23

All three of them have problems, their commonality a residential street of houses that backs the train going in and out of London each day.  As all three narrators get their turn to tell their story, the reader pieces together that they are connected in even more intricate ways.  Hawkins does a superb job of keeping the suspense up without revealing much of her hand until the very end of her tale.A young wife goes missing; one of the first person narrators, Rachel, knows the missing girl--she's observed her in passing from the window of her commuter train.  She wants to help the police; she wants to help herself.  She needs a new starting point in life because her husband has left her for another woman . . . and now they have an infant daughter.Hawkins writes of disturbed people whose faces are raw with shame and self-pity.  Her mystery revolves around need.  I listened to the unabridged audio presentation of this book; the performance gets high marks for theatricality and poignancy.  The narrators all have their flaws--there are no super human stereotypes here; together their voices pull together to find a light at the end of a dark tunnel at their own expense.Bottom line?  Some might find the characters too disagreeable to give them time to work their simple magic.  Make the time; this thriller is quietly exciting and chilling in its every day reality.

Quite the contrary, underneath it all they fear they are not beautiful and their self-esteem is absent or damaged, but they are absorbed in their own reflection, content, in fact surreptitiously delighted to subject those around them to their compulsions.

The original setting of a woman on a train observing and then imagining the lives of people she passes is abandoned. The actual setting is in the minds of the female characters expressed in first person narratives. There is virtually no character development here, but plenty of sex (much extramarital), harrowing descriptions of alcoholic misadventure, real and imagined violence.

None of the characters in the book are likable people, but that lends more to the story than detracts from it, or it could have if the author had provided a little more character development for a couple of the characters. The main character, Rachel, is a divorced alcoholic who wastes her time daydreaming about the lives of strangers while in denial of what a mess her own life has become. Her ex-husband has moved on with a new wife and has a child, but she is in denial about her place in his life. She spends her days riding a train from her flat to London, and each day, she passes by their house -- her former house. When she interjects herself into the lives of strangers, she ends up embroiled in a missing persons case. Because she drinks too much and lies too much, her sincere desire to help comes across as attention-seeking and unstable. Her constant lies hurt the victims and only make her look more insane. When she starts telling the truth, nobody believes anything she says. The ending was somewhat contrived, but there had to be an ending, and better this one than one of the alternatives, I guess. The reasoning behind the perpetrator's actions were hidden from the reader for too long. Everything that could have been discussed throughout the book was shoved into the last few pages.

I couldn't be happier that I decided to give it a go!!The characters are in my opinion what makes this book great, the book revolves mainly around the lives of Megan, Rachel and Anna, all of them being a special kind of messed up and definitely not the type of people that you would like to have in your life. While theses characters might not be your run of the mill ""good guy"", ""bad guy"" (or girl in this instance) together with a person that gets thrown into the mix to be a bit of a diversion, they feel real, we all have problems and secrets and some of us handle or suppress it better than others. The story line evolves quick enough to ensure that you are not bored for a single moment and while it lets slip a few clues which suggest what is actually going on you can never be certain until the end when things unravel fairly rapidly and even though you might have figured one or two things out along the way there will be a surprise or two waiting for you, albeit dark ones.I haven't read ""Gone Girl"" so I can unfortunately not draw that analogy but what I can tell you is that this is a spectacular read that will keep you tapping your kindle's screen without the slightest feeling of duress.",5,4,3,6,5,7,6,7,7,9

This is a compelling thriller and I really couldn't put it down. Was the conclusion as twisted and clever as I would have hoped? I can't say it left me with a big ""wow"" factor as I would have liked but still a satisfying conclusion.

I disliked them all so much, I can’t decide who I like the least – but this was an I-enjoy-not-liking-you dislike, if that makes sense. However, none of them really roused much empathy from me, and I only developed surface level feelings. Frankly, I just didn’t really care all that much about any them.Don’t get me wrong, it was good enough, and certainly held my interest. I read it pretty quickly, and definitely was invested in the story. The alternating perspectives, and the way it jumped around in time, though commonplace in books these days, was, for the most part, successful here. The writing was simple, and clipped along at a decent pace to grab and maintain my attention.All in all, I would say read it, but it’s a case of been-there-done-that for me.

"1850",3.05,"Really, more of a 2.5 star review. The initial premise of a troubled woman who becomes engrossed in the ""passing lives"" of a couple whose home she sees daily from her train commute is a good one. Unfortunately, it was the highpoint of the book for me. I'd guessed the plot by about page 60, and really kept reading to see if I was correct. (I was) I truly kept hoping I would be surprised. The story is told from the point of view of three women: Rachel, Megan and Anna, with Rachel being the main character. She's a drunk. Eventually, she becomes an such erratic unlikable, needy repetitive drunk, I was just kind of hoping she'd jump from the train. The plot is facilitated by convenient blackouts, which I could buy into, but it's the clipped points of view of the other two characters that I found to be weak writing. The chapters from Megan and Anna's POV are limited because they're clearly holding back information they know--particularly Megan. A red flag example is a short Megan chapter dedicated to inner thoughts about her lover, whom she refers to as ""he."" The lack of a proper noun tells me the ""he"" she's having an affair with in this chapter is a different ""he"" than was mentioned by name in an earlier chapter. With only so many characters in the book, ""he"" became quite obvious. If you don't think too hard while reading, I can see where The Girl on the Train is an interesting book.

It's an interesting device when an author chooses to make not one character to be sympathetic. Rachel is an alcoholic and divorced from man who has remarried but whom she is still in love with. From a train she takes daily twice a day which goes past her own house she fantasizes about a couple of doors down having the perfect marriage, while she obsessively watches developments at her old marital home.

I switched back and forth between the Kindle and Audible versions and though I liked the acting in the audiobook, I found myself just wanting to read because I could do so quicker than listening.This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl--seemingly complex characters that somehow seem completely base when you get to know them. There is no one to like or root for, which is frustrating, and you are not sure who to trust because there are multiple narrators. Everything leads up to a reveal, which I believe most readers will be able to figure out about halfway through the book, and then the story just ends.Unlike Gone Girl, I believe it was mildly well-written, capturing voice especially well. I also did not feel as if my time was wasted because it was such a fast read, and I did find myself thinking about the stories when I wasn't reading. I gave it three stars because emotionally, I let myself get involved, and any less stars would have been dishonest (but oh how I longed to give it only two!).This is a good beach or vacation read, something to excite you during the mundane winter months or pass the time on a long trip.

"1877",2.65,"I know that I'm one out of thousands who wrote a review for this book but I just couldn't help myself in relating my viewpoint.  I bought the book from amazon because every article raved about the book, calling it the new ""Gone Girl"", which I also read.  The story revolves around three women; the girl on the train, Rachel, who really should be the ""woman"" on the train because she is no longer a girl, being in her thirties.  Meagan and Anna are the other two women in the story.  Rachel, who is out of work and an alcoholic, gets on the train every day to go to a job that she no longer has and returns at the end of the day to where she shares a flat with another woman.  She is also an ex-wife of a man who has remained in their home, with his new wife, the one who caused the divorce, and their baby.  The new wife is Anna and Meagan is their neighbor.  These people all live in homes bordering the train tracks and so Rachel, on her travels to her non-job, passes by and watches them in their daily lives, still pining away for her ex-husband and builds an imaginary life for Meagan who lives with her husband a few doors down.  As each woman speaks in the novel, you get an insight into what really is going on in her life.  The problem with the story is that Rachel, Anna, and Meagan all appear to have the same personality which confused me and I found myself going back several pages to see which woman was talking.  Since they each had different problems and lives it would make sense that they had varied personalities and would not sound like Rachel.  And even though Rachel didn't want her flat-mate to find out that she lost her job, I couldn't relate to the fact that she was spending every day traveling into London and back again, just to spy on her ex-husband, etc.  Many times I wanted to put the book down and forget it but once I pay for something, I force myself to read on, hoping it will improve, thus the ending, which I found a little more to my liking.  I can't say that this is the ""new"" ""Gone Girl"", because the story is different and I couldn't really get hold of the characters as well as I should.  It's the kind of novel that you take to the beach if you're near one, or read in the backyard for an afternoon.  For a first published novel, I think the author tried to put the story into perspective as she saw it, but I felt I had to push myself to finish the book.

The last part of the book is the best part as that is when the most action occurs.  It's not hard to figure out the ending.  I wouldn't totally write this book off as it was an okay read.

"1929",3.3,"""Twice a day, I am offered a view into other lives, just for a moment. There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.”Rachel Watson rides the train to and from London every weekday. The train stops at the same faulty signal, near where Rachel use to live with her then-husband, Tom. While waiting at the signal, she looks into her favorite track-side house, hoping to see the man and woman who live there. Although Rachel doesn't know them, she calls them Jess and Jason. Rachel has woven a fantasy about them, and they have the perfect life. Except they don’t.Desperately unhappy, Rachel has developed a drinking problem. She is unable to accept that Tom has remarried and lives with his new wife and their baby in the house he shared with Rachel. Rachel has made a nuisance of herself to the point of harassment--calling Tom repeatedly and stopping by to see him, especially after she’s been drinking.What Rachel sees from the train one day will compel her to insert herself into Jess and Jason’s lives and put her own in danger.This story was quick-paced and hard to put down. Although I cringed at some of the things Rachel did, her character was so well-developed, I could sympathize with her.

It was a view of modern women but not the most modern of sensibilities--a pseudo-'60's millennial feel for one of the characters.

"1956",9.7,"Fun Mystery with Interesting Twists-Rachel, the initial narrator, is an outsider, an alcoholic who rides the train to and from a job she no longer holds.  As the story develops she is no longer an outsider but rather very much an insider.  I liked her as a narrator even while her actions drove me crazy.  So easy to sit on the outside and say well why didn't she just...... but in the end I appreciated her weakness coupled with the desire to change and become a better person, or perhaps more appropriately, a whole person. All of this also seemed to play an integral part in the story.When the voice of the victim Megan was added as a second narrator the story took on a different reality and the mystery began.  As Rachel filled her empty days riding the train she made up stories about Megan and her husband and their idyllic life, a life Rachel no longer had.  It was no surprise that their life was not as it appeared from the outside.  No one's ever really is, is it?Yet a third narrator, Rachel's husband's new wife, is added.

"1958",1.7,"I confess. The suspense in The Girl on the Train got so far under my skin that I couldn’t stop until I’d read the book all the way through to the end, costing myself hours of sleep. With as much as I read, this doesn’t happen very often, even with the most skillfully written thrillers.So there’s plenty of suspense here — but not a whole lot more. The Girl on the Train was heavily marketed as the successor to Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl, an amazingly well crafted thriller that has been on or near the top of national bestseller lists for a very long time. This one doesn’t measure up to that (admittedly) high and possibly unattainable standard.This is essentially the story of three young women, told in alternating chapters from the perspective of each of the three: Rachel, a divorcee; Anna, who is married to Rachel’s ex-husband; and Megan, who lives with her own husband. Megan and Anna’s homes — the latter was Rachel’s home not long before — are situated along the tracks of the train that Rachel takes every day to and from work. Prone to fantasizing, Rachel builds an elaborate story around her daily glimpses of Megan and her husband, neither of whom she has met. The plot unfolds as the women’s stories intersect — and, you guessed it, it’s not a pretty tale.If there’s a message in The Girl on the Train, it may be summed up in a single sentence by the author: “I have never understood how people can disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.”Oh, and there’s another message to take from this book: beware of marketers who hype new books as “a worthy successor to [fill-in-the-blank].",3,11,2,3,3,3,3,7,8,8
"1959",1.15,"The plot isn't bad, but the characters are very poorly written.  Apart from the fact that none of them are likeable, they simply aren't very distinguishable either.  The women all have similar personalities - weak judgment, bad decision-making, easily manipulated, bad tempered.  And the male characters were equally unoriginal and similar to each other - self-centered, mean, capable of violence.At the start the book had some promise.  The premise, while in some ways derivative of Hitchcock's movie ""Rear Window,"" seemed interesting.  A woman who commutes into London every day sees something suspicious as her train passes by the backyards of a small subdivision.  The story evolves from there as the suspicious event starts the unraveling of several lives, as described alternately by some of the main characters.But while the book is an easy read, and the essence of the mystery holds the reader's attention reasonably well, I found myself racing to the end not because it was so exciting but just to be done with the book.  The cast of characters, and especially ""the girl on the train,"" comprised a collection of some of the most unlikeable individuals I've ever encountered in a novel of this type and I couldn't wait for the story to be over.

I didn't solve it until right at the end. This is well worth reading.",1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,5

"2056",6.05,"Three unreliable, and unlikable, women narrate this debut thriller that we read for book club - eight women, ages 29 to 40, of various backgrounds read this and sat for discussion.On a whole we found that we couldn't relate to any of the characters, nor did we like them.Rachel mourns the lost of her ex-husband and stalks him by taking a train to No Destination every day so she can drive behind his house (her old house) and pointedly ignores it (?) under the pretense of watching his neighbor a few doors down. The train must only pass these house for a 15 or 30 seconds, but in that time it's enough for alcoholic Rachel to become fixated on the neighbors and invite a romance for them in her head. Ie, they have the perfect life that she never got to have. Rachel is a sad, pathetic drunk with no life focus/ideas/motivation, refuses to get help for the most part, and is most likely mentally disturbed. She's a voyeur, a liar, in denial, delusional, has black outs and is a bad friend and person. Despite everything she goes through, she doesn't learn much and is ultimately given assistance by her mother... telling us that she continues to be a waste of air albeit a sober one.Megan (aka Jess) is somewhat more excusable in her lameness as she suffered some terrible losses in her life. But whatever sympathy you feel for her is absolved as you get to know her. She doesn't take accountability for her life, she lives free and fancy with the only commitment she has being her husband, and she cannot even honor that. Given that she only has one thing in her life to be loyal to and can't manage it, she comes across as another waste. She acts as though sitting all day and being loved and cared for is awful but she doesn't take any steps to change her life.Anna, Rachel’s ex-husband’s wife, has a very small narrative (really Train is mostly Rachel's story with a bit from Megan) is a pointedly unlikable person, who was actually likable to us. Regardless of her shallow perspective on life and her cruel side, we thought she was the most ""real"" and energized of the three women presented. She's someone you can root for, even if she's a bit of a villain. Of the three women she's the only one who seemed to know herself and take control of her life. But even that being said, her voice is the smallest, her window the tiniest, so it didn't improve much of the overall story.There are no twists that felt original in this thriller. The ending was a let-down. There was nothing new or inventive about the way the story unfolded.  The red herrings are annoying instead of clever (the pile of clothes, the pile of clothes, the pile of clothes that went nowhere). It felt so typical and old... but NOT in the good Hitchcock way - which it's been compared to (how? why? how?!). The villain was SO cheesy. The dialogue at the climax felt like a spoof on a thriller instead of a thriller itself. The actions of the characters the entire novel seemed bizarre and illogical. We had a hard time making sense of any of it.. but we also realized we just didn't care either. Everyone was just so unlikable.We always play games at book club - and this one inspired very little gaming. There wasn't really a lot to go on or develop. The activities were pretty blah compared to other books we've read.We rated this one ""best drink coaster"" of Book Club Books 2015.

Yes people are inherently flawed, but the characters in this book are overwhelmingly rotten awful people - all for very different reasons, but still.

I won't give away any spoilers and I will acknowledge that Rachel ( the protagonist) has had a hard time but at a certain point, you have to rise above your circumstances or the bad hand you've been dealt (don't you?).

Many others have already given a synopsis, so here are my pros/cons:Pros:-The book is a quick read and is entertaining.- I liked the overall story quite a bit (the writing style was lacking)- I hate when I solve the mystery too early. This one had me guessing for quite some time, and the ending was believable-- accomplishing both of those tasks is rare.Cons:- The writing style. The story is told in first person from 3 different characters, but the style never changed from character to character. They felt one-dimensional and the change in perspective seemed more like a device to tell the story than anything else.- I didn't like any of the characters. This doesn't bother some people, but I like having someone to root for.- While the ending was believable, it felt rushed. Once you figure out what happened, you get about 10-15 pages of resolution.I'd recommend this book as a fun, (relatively) cheap read.

There are three voices, and they all sound exactly the same.  But for Ms. Hawkins telling you what character is narrating, you'd never know which woman is which.  The three narrators are given slightly unique traits: one's a drinker, the other has a baby and the last one is missing.  The audio book was superior because three women narrated so they had actual unique voices, which helped differentiate the otherwise similar characters.I wouldn't recommend the book, but if you need something to while away a short plane ride, it isn't terrible.",1,0,1,3,3,4,1,3,4,8

The blurbs and reviews compare The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl and talk about the unreliable narration and surprise ending, so I was really coming up with some wild scenarios in my head. Instead, the ending was predictable and I guessed it easily.It started off fantastic. The reader gets the point of view from three characters: the main character, Rachel; Anna, the woman who stole Rachel's husband; and Megan, the focus of the crime. It was awesome getting different POV and, honestly, the more the book progressed the more I hated everyone.The book was ripe with adultery, lies and alcoholism. The ""unreliable narration"" was certainly dead-on due to Hawkins making me consider everyone as a suspect from either their inner monologue or the way they acted around others, treated others or were thought of by others. I was absorbed in their lives and how everything connected.I was pretty pissed at Rachel throughout, but I also deeply pitied her. She was a horrible alcoholic who stalked her ex-husband and his new family. She--almost creepily--made up a whole life for a couple she watched daily on her train ride (it's one thing to just make up a story; it's another to build on the story and believe the attributes you created are true). She was someone you wouldn't befriend and, if you were friends with her, you'd sever the friendship the first change you had. But, she had reasons for her drinking and actions that I could understand. I still wished she'd found better avenues to deal with her pain but I sympathized with her the more I learned.I went through the same roller coaster of emotions with Anna and Megan. Anna I felt bad for because her husband's ex-wife was constantly coming around, two years after their divorce, but Anna was the cause of their divorce (or at least the final reason for Tom to sign the papers), so I also felt a bit like it was karma. Megan I couldn't figure out, then I was pissed at her, then she reveals something huge and I felt so, so bad for her and couldn't even imagine what I'd have done in her shoes.Hawkins was great at confusing my feelings and keeping me on edge to find out how it would end. Then, the ending came and it was lackluster. Yes, revelations happened and I suppose the very end could have come as a surprise, but the ""who-done-it"" was almost obvious. It could be Hawkins gave a little too much away in hints towards the end; it could be my expectations were set too high; or it could be that the ending was similar to many other books and I was expecting/hoping for something more jaw-dropping and original. Whatever the reason, I wasn't impressed.I still recommend the book--the writing is fantastic and Hawkins created complex characters who were completely flushed out.

It can get little confusing, especially when they jumble time periods, but you slowly learn the whole story by listening to each one. I was intrigued in the first third, bored somewhat by Rachel’s interminable alcohol black-outs in the middle, but then was gripped through the final third as the full truth began to be revealed. It has almost no action (until the end) and is mostly a lot of sad people talking about their sad lives, but the way the author broke up this murder mystery made it interesting.

Since reading it, I have read some of the reviews and find it fascinating how much effort is put into comparing this to ""Gone Girl.""  I liked both novels but did not love either, however, I see the connection a bit, although in the end, not enough to think it has any importance.I like that this book started out vague, with our only information coming as the thoughts of a woman, only during her twice daily train. Rides. Her thoughts were vague and murky and we didn't have a clue what any of her references were about, but as she was an alcoholic, who lied to herself, suffered blackouts, and spun fantasies about people she glimpsed from the train, that feeling of cloudy, unreliable thinking was strangely real. Rachel felt very real, especially as she made promises to herself to change, and failed to keep those promises.  She was very human. Not your best choice of friend perhaps, but someone people could love, and someone who inspired loyalty I friends, at least for awhile.The next voices added in more details, and other layers of lies and deceptions and failure to make correct assumptions. The pacing quickened and the details began to merge and by the end of the novel, I couldn't stop reading. I think the story was told in a very unique way, and the whole slow build up was enjoyable. I didn't like the ending, it felt rushed and forced, where the rest of the book felt very possible, it almost felt too contrived to believe.Still, was it worth the time and money I spent to read it?

At that point, the narrative becomes strained and intentionally drawn out.  Finally, it is a well-known device of poorly written mysteries for the killer to ""tell all"" near the end of the novel.  The best mysteries lay out all of the pieces of evidence as they proceed and there's no need for the killer to engage in revelations at the end of the book because everything has already been laid out.

The author repeats a lot of words and actions that the different characters make and I can't help wondering if it is simply because she likes using them or if there is a deeper meaning for why she chose those words. For example, the word ""cathartic"" is used quite a bit and also the action of a male character rubbing the cheekbone of a female character happens a number of times as well.I also found it interesting how the ""likability"" of every character continued to change drastically. Each character has moments where you believe he or she is ""good"" then moments where you think, ""oh, this is the bad character.""

But she chooses the same train that takes her right past her old home, which her ex-husband now shares with his new wife and baby.

She watches another young couple, giving them names and fantasizing about their lives, notably how perfect and perfectly in love they are.  The shock of learning how utterly different people and circumstances really are than the way they appear is the vehicle for Rachel to question her assumptions about her own past and present.Yes, there are reaches, demands that we suspend, if not belief, common sense, but this is hardly a new demand from writers.As far as the ""Gone Girl"" comparisons go, I'll just say that this is the second book I've read since ""Gone Girl"" that uses the rotating narration of some main characters.

Each of the three narrative characters has a hand in the puzzle and Hawkins does an amazing job of letting them emerge as independent persons.

For whatever reason, I had a hard time connecting with the book in the beginning, but kept at it at the insistence of so many friends. I am so glad I did. It was slow at the beginning, but it paid off in the end. The book is told from the point of view of three different women. The unreliable narrator tactic worked well with the way the author told the story from different dates. If you liked Gone Girl you will like this book. I don't see how my review is even necessary or helpful considering how many reviews this amazing book and author already have, but I wanted to share anyway. Once I got into the book, I could not put it down and had to know what would happen next. I guessed who the killer was, but I don't think that means anything. The book is a psychological thriller not a mystery so the suspense comes from wondering if our MC will escape the dangers posed by the villain and not from solving the mystery of who dun it. It was a nail biting experience at the end as I worried for two of the main characters and wondered what would happen. I can't say more without giving it away.If you are one of the few who has not read this book, you simply must read it. Please don't let the slow start put you off. You will see, soon enough that it was worth the wait. This novel is unique and not like any other book out there. It shares many of the same plot techniques and narrative as Gone Girl, but the story is completely different from Gone Girl and from any other book. That's what makes the book such a hit.If you have read this book and loved it like I did, I highly recommend that you read, Peter Swanson's The Kind Worth Killing. It hooks you much quicker and it is every bit as good as The Girl on the Train. Both are at the top of my all time favorite books.

The plot is not too complicated, so it’s perfect for laid-back summer brain where you might not be completely engaged every time you pick up the book. Prepare yourself for a main character that you will not like. This makes the story itself shine more than the main character, which is a very interesting.

Not fast, but compelling.  The characters are not chock-full of surprises until the very end of the novel, but they are moved along well enough by author Paula Hawkins.

I’m a little late to this party, so my thoughts may not matter, but let me begin by stating that this book was simply AMAZING!The Girl on the Train is an intriguing and an utterly compelling literary masterpiece that has become one of my favorite reads this year.  What started out as a slow burn blazed into this fire – this raging desire to continue reading this twisted tale that kept me guessing throughout.  This whole story sucked me in – keeping me on the edge of my seat and captivated with each word. This is one of those books that I am not quite sure why I waited so long to start and in the end I was kicking myself for putting it off for so long. This book consumed me and I found myself not wanting to put it down for even a second.The Girl on the Train will entrance you with the almost lyrical prose and challenge you as you try to peel back the many layers of the complex story.  The story is told from three POV’s and the author switches perspectives flawlessly throughout.  It is extremely well-written and the plot flowed smoothly and effortlessly.  Ms. Hawkins is a new author for me, but one that I will be on the lookout for in the future.  This book is some seriously good writing and one that will appeal to anyone looking for a suspenseful and thrilling read.
